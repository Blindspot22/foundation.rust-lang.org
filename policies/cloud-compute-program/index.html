<p>This Rust Maintainer Cloud Compute Access Agreement (together with the other policies below, the “Agreement”) is a legal contract between (1) the Rust Foundation (“Foundation,” “we,” or “us”); and (2) you, the individual using the Services provided under this agreement. The Agreement governs your access to and use of the cloud compute services (the “Services”) made available by the Foundation to Rust maintainers for the purpose of developing, testing, researching, and debugging the Rust compiler and related tools (together, “Rust”).</p>
<p>By using the Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. You also agree to be bound by the Rust Foundation <a href="/policies/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> (the “Privacy Policy”), and <a href="/policies/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> (the “Code of Conduct”), each of which are incorporated into this Agreement. We may change the terms of this Agreement from time to time and will notify you of changes by posting new terms on the Foundation website. If you continue to use the Services following notice of any modifications, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the modifications.</p>
<h3 id="1.-services.">1. Services. <a class="direct-link" href="#1.-services.">#</a></h3>
<p>1.1. Purpose. Foundation makes the Services available to you to support your contributions to the development and maintenance of Rust. Your use of the Services is subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>1.2. Accounts. To be eligible for an account, you must be at least 13 years old. You may not share your account with others; each individual person who uses the Services must use their own account.

You agree to promptly notify us if you believe your account has been misused, or if your credentials are compromised.</p>
<p>1.3. Not a Backup or Storage Site. The Services are intended solely to provide access to compute resources to enable your contributions to Rust. They are not intended for use as a data backup or storage service and you are responsible for ensuring that you maintain copies of any materials uploaded to the Services.</p>
<p>1.4. Modifications. We may make changes to the Services or discontinue some or all of the Services without prior notification to you.</p>
<h3 id="2.-use-of-the-services.">2. Use of the Services. <a class="direct-link" href="#2.-use-of-the-services.">#</a></h3>
<p>2.1. Acceptable Use. The Services are intended to support your contributions to the open source Rust Project, including:</p>
<p>(a) development of improvements to the Rust language;</p>
<p>(b) development of tests for Rust and associated tools hosted by the Rust Project; and</p>
<p>(c) development of documentation for incorporation into the Rust code base.</p>
<p>2.2. Unacceptable Use. You agree not to use the Services to:</p>
<p>(a) violate any local, state, national, foreign, or international statute, regulation, rule, order, treaty, or other law;</p>

<p>(c) perform any resource-intensive activity unrelated to your Rust contributions, including data mining, cryptocurrency mining, or operating robots or similar data gathering or extraction methods;</p>
<p>(d) attempt to gain unauthorized access to any system, whether through hacking, password mining, or any other means; or</p>
<p>(e) infringe any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other right.</p>
<p>2.2. Suspension. If you use the Services in a manner that we determine is (a) contrary to the Acceptable Use Policy or Code of Conduct, or (b) harmful to the Services or other users of the Services, then we may suspend your account or limit your use of the Services.</p>
