		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the next five weeks, we&#39;ll be running a series called &amp;quot;Getting to know the board&amp;quot;, publishing blog posts from each member of the Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, introducing them to the community. You can view the posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/getting%20to%20know%20the%20board%20series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings fellow Rustaceans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an honor to serve you as lead editor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://this-week-in-rust.org/&quot;&gt;This Week in Rust&lt;/a&gt;, as a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations&quot;&gt;Async Foundations working group&lt;/a&gt;, and now as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board/&quot;&gt;Rust Foundation board member&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found success with Rust, and was able to lift others to their own success, through the global Rustacean community and, especially, the actions of Rust’s maintainers. We are a group of people where empathy and personal maturity are as important as (if not more important than) technical excellence. We are a shining example of how an open source community can achieve great advancements - advancements with the potential to affect an entire industry - and still treat each other with dignity, respect, and support. We are not successful in spite of our higher standard of conduct, we are successful because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you knew me as a member of the Rust team at Mozilla. After the August 2020 layoffs, I had the opportunity to join Microsoft as a Principal Software Engineer in the Open Source Programs Office. While it’s no secret Microsoft was at odds with open source in the past, I can assure you from my own personal experience that a true transformation has taken place. Microsoft understands that open source software is critical for its success as a business and for the success of our customers. Moreover, Microsoft also understands that, in order for the projects we depend on to be successful, we must behave as exemplary open source citizens, and engage meaningfully with the open source community. This includes donating money as a sponsor of the Rust Foundation. It also includes dedicating engineering effort to the Rust project to make it not only work better for Microsoft but also for all Rustaceans across the world. Microsoft is excited about the opportunities to engage with and give back to the community, and expects to be working closely with Rust’s maintainers on the compiler, core tooling, documentation, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to joining the Rust Foundation, my primary non-profit experience was as a board director of &lt;a href=&quot;https://operationcode.org/&quot;&gt;Operation Code&lt;/a&gt;. Operation Code is an organization dedicated to teaching software engineering skills to the military community and their families. Through my experience there, I learned that the highest duty of any board member is always to those we serve. Sponsors and donors certainly are vital to a foundation’s success, but addressing their needs must never come at the expense of the community that is the reason for our existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my role as Microsoft’s representative on the Rust Foundation board is to represent the interests of Microsoft to the Rust community, but it is even more important for me to represent and advocate for the interests of the Rust’s maintainers and community to Microsoft. Understanding and balancing these needs and finding common ground will not always be easy, but it is something we Rustaceans do every day through our RFC process. There is so much opportunity for us to learn from each other, to build with each other, to design solutions we never would have considered previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My success as a board member will be measured by the success of Rust’s maintainers and the entire Rustacean community. And I need your help. One of the best ways to help me is to continue commenting on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs&quot;&gt;RFCs&lt;/a&gt;. This helps me understand your needs and how I can best support them both as a board member and as a fellow Rustacean. Additionally, since most Rust meetups are still online, I will be attending as many of them as I can over the next few months. Please don’t hesitate to approach me and introduce yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot wait to see what we build together.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the next five weeks, we&#39;ll be running a series called &amp;quot;Getting to know the board&amp;quot;, publishing blog posts from each member of the Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, introducing them to the community. You can view the posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/getting%20to%20know%20the%20board%20series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, Rust community! My name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://tmandry.gitlab.io/blog/&quot;&gt;Tyler Mandry&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m excited to serve as&lt;br /&gt;
the project director for quality on the board of the Rust Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey with Rust started about five years ago. I was what you might call&lt;br /&gt;
a reluctant enthusiast. I love learning new ways of doing things, but I’m&lt;br /&gt;
also somewhat skeptical of “new tech hype.” At the time, I worked in&lt;br /&gt;
high-performance computing. Eventually I realized a huge portion of our time&lt;br /&gt;
was spent chasing down bugs, like segfaults and data races, that were&lt;br /&gt;
difficult to reproduce and could never have existed in a language like&lt;br /&gt;
Rust.[1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling the pain on a daily basis that Rust promised to prevent was what&lt;br /&gt;
finally got me interested. But what got me hooked – and inspired me to&lt;br /&gt;
contribute – was the thoughtfulness and openness of the project itself. The&lt;br /&gt;
technical decisions were all made in the open, and it was plain that everyone&lt;br /&gt;
cared deeply about making Rust the best it could be. No one knew me in the&lt;br /&gt;
Rust community, but I was able to join a working group and contribute changes&lt;br /&gt;
right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019 I joined Google to work on the Fuchsia operating system, supporting&lt;br /&gt;
Rust development, and I began leading the Rust on Fuchsia team in early 2020.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve contributed a number of things in my time here like async/await compiler&lt;br /&gt;
optimizations, mentored work like source-based code coverage, and lead the&lt;br /&gt;
async foundations working group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else should you know about me? Well, when I’m not in front of a computer&lt;br /&gt;
I’m often on my bike, most likely listening to a podcast. I just began&lt;br /&gt;
learning to play piano – ask me how that’s going in six months.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-road-ahead&quot;&gt;The road ahead &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/posts/2021-03-18-introducing-tyler-mandry/#the-road-ahead&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking around, it’s becoming clear that Rust will play a big role in&lt;br /&gt;
how we write software over the next 5-10 years – or more. Reliability,&lt;br /&gt;
efficiency, and productivity is a combination that will be in demand for a&lt;br /&gt;
long time to come. I’m extremely excited to see more and more developers&lt;br /&gt;
learning Rust every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see the establishment of a Rust foundation as a major step forward in the&lt;br /&gt;
maturity of the project, not unlike what releasing Rust 1.0 meant for the&lt;br /&gt;
language itself. Starting a foundation makes the project more sustainable&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; unlocks a lot of new possibilities. I think the next two years will&lt;br /&gt;
involve “unlearning” all the things we thought we couldn’t do, but now can&lt;br /&gt;
thanks to dedicated funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what can the foundation do to improve quality? I have specific ideas, but&lt;br /&gt;
I think it’s most important that the project first has an &lt;em&gt;accurate,&lt;br /&gt;
comprehensive, detailed, and up-to-date&lt;/em&gt; view of how it’s doing. So this year,&lt;br /&gt;
I’d like to begin by helping Rust contributors &lt;em&gt;fix blind spots&lt;/em&gt; like where&lt;br /&gt;
there are gaps in documentation and compiler errors, with the ability to&lt;br /&gt;
measure changes over time. Another thing we don’t monitor is how compiled&lt;br /&gt;
code actually performs; the compiler team &lt;a href=&quot;https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/help-needed-corpus-for-measuring-runtime-performance-of-generated-code/6794&quot;&gt;has wanted this&lt;/a&gt; for a long&lt;br /&gt;
time, and the Foundation could help make it happen. Finally, it’d be nice to&lt;br /&gt;
have more visibility into changes in dependencies, like LLVM and system&lt;br /&gt;
runtime libraries, and how that could affect our pace of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly ambitious, and I don’t expect it all to happen overnight.&lt;br /&gt;
But I think the project will benefit greatly from making more informed&lt;br /&gt;
decisions, and I hope this will allow Rust to continue the impressive&lt;br /&gt;
trajectory it’s had so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a joy to work on Rust, and I get the sense that we’re all just&lt;br /&gt;
getting started. I’m looking forward to what the Rust project, including the&lt;br /&gt;
foundation, will do in 2021 and beyond. I hope you are too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]: That’s not to say that the language we were using at the time &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
the problems, just that it failed to prevent them!&lt;br /&gt;
[2]: And in a year, but that seems too distant to motivate me today. This is&lt;br /&gt;
the biggest accountability stunt I’ve pulled by far.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the next five weeks, we&#39;ll be running a series called &amp;quot;Getting to know the board&amp;quot;, publishing blog posts from each member of the Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, introducing them to the community. You can view the posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/getting%20to%20know%20the%20board%20series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&#39;m &lt;a href=&quot;https://bholley.net/about/&quot;&gt;Bobby Holley&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve been a Mozillian since 2008, and currently work in the office of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/leadership/#eric-rescorla&quot;&gt;Firefox CTO&lt;/a&gt; on technical strategy and coordination. Last month I joined the Rust Foundation’s inaugural &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board/&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, and today I thought I’d share a bit about why I’m here, what I like about Rust, and why I’m excited for its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://venge.net/graydon/talks/intro-talk-2.pdf&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of Rust in 2010, I&#39;ve had the privilege of watching it grow from a skunkworks side-project into the force of nature it is today. I wasn&#39;t involved much during the early years, but in 2015 I began working with the Servo team to figure out how to bring Rust’s unique capabilities to Firefox. We focused on the CSS engine because it was both performance-critical and extremely complex: in principle we wanted to parallelize it, but in practice couldn’t see a realistic path with C++ concurrency. Rust’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html&quot;&gt;mutability control&lt;/a&gt; and package ecosystem were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=220&amp;amp;v=UN_iIExdB9Q&quot;&gt;exactly what we needed&lt;/a&gt;, and allowed us to ship &lt;a href=&quot;https://bholley.net/blog/2017/stylo.html&quot;&gt;Stylo&lt;/a&gt; with better performance, fewer bugs, and in less time than anyone thought possible. Since then I’ve worked on several other Rust-based initiatives in Firefox such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/the-whole-web-at-maximum-fps-how-webrender-gets-rid-of-jank/&quot;&gt;WebRender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/neqo/&quot;&gt;Neqo&lt;/a&gt;, all of which have continued to deepen my appreciation for both the language and the community around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early (pre-1.0) days, I had the mistaken impression that Rust was just for building browsers at Mozilla. So when I first joined #rust on IRC, I was surprised to find it teeming with smart and friendly people — often with no other connection to Mozilla — working together to use the language and move it forward. It’s clear to me now that this broad coalition was crucial. &lt;a href=&quot;http://venge.net/graydon/talks/intro-talk-2.pdf#page=6&quot;&gt;From the start&lt;/a&gt;, Rust did not aim to distinguish itself with novel technical ideas, but rather sought to bring together a number of well-understood concepts from the research community into something coherent, learnable, and broadly useful. This is hard work that takes a village, particularly the feedback loop around feature design, wide experimentation, and iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some sense, the most important insight behind Rust’s success was not about technology but rather about people. Early on the Rust team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/6ewjt5/question_about_rusts_odd_code_of_conduct/didrult/&quot;&gt;made it a priority&lt;/a&gt; to build a healthy and welcoming community around the project. This attracted talented contributors, helped them collaborate productively, and made it fun to stick around. This resulted in excellent software, which in turn attracted even more talent. This approach seems simple and obvious in retrospect, which is a reaction I frequently have to things that Rust gets right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla incubated Rust to build a better Firefox and contribute to a better Internet, but today it&#39;s clear that Rust has outgrown its roots. In its new home with the Rust Foundation, Rust will have the room to grow into its own success, while continuing to amplify some of the core values that Mozilla shares with the Rust community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety&lt;/strong&gt; in a connected world requires securing the browser, but also securing other client software along with the servers that handle people&#39;s data. Rust’s memory safety properties eliminate entire classes of exploits, and bringing those guarantees to more programs can protect people from harm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empowering&lt;/strong&gt; people to create things themselves involves building tools that are safe, performant, and approachable. Web technologies like HTML and JavaScript have dramatically lowered the barrier to publishing information and interactive experiences, but some disciplines — like high-performance or embedded development — have traditionally required experts-only languages like C. Rust’s type checking, tooling, and documentation offer a much more accessible path for these use-cases, allowing more people to build more things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foundational technologies should be developed in a truly &lt;strong&gt;open&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;collaborative&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;inclusive&lt;/strong&gt; way. Since its inception, the Rust project has set a very high standard for constructive dialog and positive collaboration, and serves as a model for how to build a healthy community around open-source technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla and the Rust project are well-aligned on these values today, and you can expect us to champion them in our engagement with the Rust Foundation going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust exists because of the efforts of countless people working together to make software better, and the Foundation exists to empower and support those people to do their best work. This is an important chapter in Rust&#39;s history, and I&#39;m excited to be a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Hello World!</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/posts/2021-02-08-hello-world/"/>
		<updated>2021-02-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/posts/2021-02-08-hello-world/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, on behalf of the Rust Core team, I’m excited to announce the Rust Foundation, a new independent non-profit organization to steward the Rust programming language and ecosystem, with a unique focus on supporting the set of maintainers that govern and develop the project. The Rust Foundation will hold its first board meeting tomorrow, February 9th, at 4pm CT. &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board/&quot;&gt;The board of directors is composed of 5 directors from our Founding member companies, AWS, Huawei, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla, as well as 5 directors from project leadership, 2 representing the Core Team, as well as 3 project areas: Reliability, Quality, and Collaboration. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marks a huge step in the growth of Rust on several axes; not the least of which, a formal, financial commitment from a set of global industry leading companies, heralding Rust’s arrival as an enterprise production-ready technology. I am personally moved, and motivated, by the sense of responsibility that comes from this commitment. Our founding sponsors’ eager and enthusiastic participation is not only a promise to maintain and sustain Rust as what it is today, but an endorsement of Rust’s values and a dedication to share the responsibility of cultivating the future that Rust aspires to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla, the original home of the Rust project, has transferred all trademark and infrastructure assets, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/&quot;&gt;crates.io package registry&lt;/a&gt;, to the Rust Foundation. We’re filled with gratitude for Mozilla whose thoughtful incubation of the project from its inception as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.mozilla.org/rust/&quot;&gt;research project&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html&quot;&gt;establishing independent governance with the 1.0 release in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, has led us to this moment, as we set out as a fully independent organization. Without their support, we wouldn’t find ourselves in the position we do today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, Rust, the programming language, has been a barrier-breaking technology- deconstructing previously assumed-immovable tradeoffs and binary oppositions. Slogans like “concurrency without data races”, “memory safety without garbage collection”, and ultimately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO1z-7cuRYI&quot;&gt;“hack without fear”&lt;/a&gt;, speak to the perspective-challenging character of Rust’s unique marriage of academic research and industry practicality. But to suggest that Rust’s impact is solely technical would be to miss a majority of the story. As a &lt;a href=&quot;https://brson.github.io/fireflowers/&quot;&gt;flurry of blog posts&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ag_dubs/fire-flowers-and-marios-marketing-rust-996b3fdbe8f3&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/247406.html&quot;&gt;leaders&lt;/a&gt; discussed in 2016: &lt;a href=&quot;https://steveklabnik.com/writing/rust-is-more-than-safety&quot;&gt;Rust’s product is not a programming language or a compiler&lt;/a&gt;. Rust’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefeedbackloop.xyz/safety-is-rusts-fireflower/&quot;&gt;product is the experience of being a Rust developer&lt;/a&gt; and it follows that Rust’s website declares its official slogan: “A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’ve always taken the opportunity to editorialize this with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/www.rust-lang.org/commit/f59adeb7fa645e282b2359cb7e10e331ac00d9c5&quot;&gt;the original version I penned in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and recently reiterated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/IwPRu5FhfIQ?t=2164&quot;&gt;my portion of the RustConf 2020 keynote&lt;/a&gt;: “A language empowering everyone, but especially folks who thought that systems programming wasn’t for them.” One of the most powerful driving forces of the Rust project is the simultaneous belief in the power of systems programming and the commitment to ensuring that such power is wieldable by &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;. The accessibility at the heart of Rust’s message of empowerment has motivated every part of the project, from first class package management and developer toolchain, to the culture of excellent error messages and documentation, to international event organizers and translators, to the code of conduct and moderation team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Rust is so much more than a programming language and a community- Rust also represents a new, radical, way to collaborate on open source projects.  The decision making power within the Rust project is uniquely delegated and distributed; with the core team holding little more privilege than other more specialized teams. Rust counts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/governance&quot;&gt;more than 100 team members&lt;/a&gt; as leaders in the design and maintenance of the project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thanks.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;shepherding nearly 6000 contributors to the rust-lang/rust repo alone since the project’s first release&lt;/a&gt;. Through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs&quot;&gt;Rust’s RFC process&lt;/a&gt;, more than 1000 people have made nearly 500 decisions that represent the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#when-you-need-to-follow-this-process&quot;&gt;critical and strategic product and design decisions for the project&lt;/a&gt;. Guiding principles like &lt;a href=&quot;http://aturon.github.io/tech/2018/05/25/listening-part-1/#the-great-int-debate-and-the-no-new-rationale-rule&quot;&gt;“no new rationale”&lt;/a&gt; ensure that these conversations happen fully in the open, giving operational teeth to the fundamental beliefs of the project: that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2020/12/30/the-more-things-change/#on-pluralism-and-the-rust-organization&quot;&gt;plurality of voices&lt;/a&gt; is better than one; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/JLstJFvdl4s?t=1808&quot;&gt;collaboration is not zero-sum&lt;/a&gt;; that we are stronger, and smarter, as a group than alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust believes that the ability of anyone to participate in the design and development of Rust is a mission critical aspect of building a language and ecosystem that is truly accessible to everyone. And the potential of such a system has bore fruit: It is not a mistake that such a promising technology has emerged from such a progressive conception of collaboration. But such a system comes at a cost; a cost that is too often invisible and thus unaccounted for. For too long, open source as both an industry and a community has done a poor audit of its expenses. Notably, ignoring the price of what I’d controversially argue is the core value proposition of open source software: the freedom to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting several decades ago, open source foundations were established to cultivate the use of open source software in commercial organizations large and small. Today, as we announce the Rust Foundation, we build on the incredible success of their mission: We no longer need to evangelize the use of open source software to the largest and most influential players in our industry; we can assume it. Our challenge is a new one, one that emerges from that accomplishment- we need to support and prepare our maintainers and open governance structures to support what promises to be a period of record breaking growth and adoption. The Rust Foundation seeks to center and stabilize the experiences of the amazing people who are responsible for making Rust what it is today, and to generalize and establish a healthier maintainer experience and ecology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is an incredibly exciting moment for Rust. I wrote my first (still publicly available) lines of Rust nearly 5 years ago and it’s amazing to see how far we have come and the promise of how far we might go. Our founding members represent a 2 year commitment to a more than million dollar yearly budget to develop services, programs, and events that will support the Rust project maintainers in building the best possible Rust, and we’ve only just begun.
