To the right, a circular frame with a zig-zag edge contains a headshot of Seth Markle. Underneath is smaller white text reading &amp;quot;Seth Markle, Member Director - AWS&amp;quot;&quot; title=&quot;Seth Markle Announcement&quot; src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-11-10-welcoming-seth-markle-to-the-rust-foundation-board/Board-Announcements.png&quot; /&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/welcoming-seth-markle-to-the-rust-foundation-board/#-2&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rust-foundation-is-thrilled-to-share-that-seth-markle-has-joined-the-rust-foundation-board-of-directors-as-member-director-for-aws-(a-rust-foundation-platinum-member).&quot;&gt;The Rust Foundation is thrilled to share that Seth Markle has joined the Rust Foundation Board of Directors as Member Director for &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; (a Rust Foundation Platinum Member).  &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/welcoming-seth-markle-to-the-rust-foundation-board/#the-rust-foundation-is-thrilled-to-share-that-seth-markle-has-joined-the-rust-foundation-board-of-directors-as-member-director-for-aws-(a-rust-foundation-platinum-member).&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Senior Principal Software Engineer at AWS, Seth works on Amazon Simple Storage Service (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot;&gt;Amazon S3&lt;/a&gt;), specifically focusing on data storage and large-scale distributed systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth has been a strong advocate for Rust internally at AWS ever since he used it to build a new storage node implementation back in 2018. He is passionate about building correct, highly performant systems that underpin some of the largest infrastructure in the world. On his new role as Member Director for AWS on the Rust Foundation board, Seth says…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I have seen how Rust enables developers to write highly performant, efficient code while providing modern language features that help ensure correctness across large code bases. We have crossed an inflection point where many developers confidently choose to use Rust. I’m excited about Rust’s continued evolution and thrilled to be a part of the Rust Foundation. I look forward to helping support this diverse community of both users and maintainers.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foundation is clearly thrilled to welcome Seth to the board as the new AWS Member Director, but this change to our leadership team comes with another bittersweet update: the upcoming departure of Shane Miller from our board as Chairperson. While Shane is still on the board as Chairperson, Seth is the exclusive Member Director for AWS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be bidding Shane a proper farewell in a dedicated post towards the end of her tenure in December. Stay tuned! In the meantime, please join us in thanking Shane for her leadership on the Rust Foundation board!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An election for a new Rust Foundation Chairperson will be held in during the January 2023 board meeting. Board Secretary Mark Rousskov will serve as the Interim Chairperson until a new Chairperson is elected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Q3 2022 Recap: A summary from Rebecca Rumbul</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/q3-2022-update-a-recap-from-rebecca-rumb/"/>
		<updated>2022-11-01T18:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/q3-2022-update-a-recap-from-rebecca-rumb/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; alt=&quot;White Rust Foundation logo at top (letter &amp;quot;R&amp;quot; inside gear icon) with the following white bolded text heading: “Q3 2022 Update”. Italicized subheading in white reads “from Executive Director Rebecca Rumbul”. To the right, a circular frame with a zig-zag edge contains a headshot of Rebecca Rumbul.&quot; title=&quot;Q3 Update&quot; src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-11-01-q3-update/q3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;since-november-is-officially-upon-us%2C-the-rust-foundation-owes-a-recap-of-the-activities-and-progress-we-made-as-an-organization-over-the-last-quarter-%E2%80%94-q3.-here%E2%80%99s-a-look-at-what-we-accomplished-(and-the-developments-surrounding-it)-in-july%2C-august%2C-and-september-2022.-towards-the-end-of-december%2C-we%E2%80%99ll-share-a-q4-update-post-to-round-out-the-year!&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since November is officially upon us, the Rust Foundation owes a recap of the activities and progress we made as an organization over the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; quarter — Q3. Here’s a look at what we accomplished (and the developments surrounding it) in July, August, and September 2022. Towards the end of December, we’ll share a Q4 update post to round out the year!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/q3-2022-update-a-recap-from-rebecca-rumb/#since-november-is-officially-upon-us%2C-the-rust-foundation-owes-a-recap-of-the-activities-and-progress-we-made-as-an-organization-over-the-last-quarter-%E2%80%94-q3.-here%E2%80%99s-a-look-at-what-we-accomplished-(and-the-developments-surrounding-it)-in-july%2C-august%2C-and-september-2022.-towards-the-end-of-december%2C-we%E2%80%99ll-share-a-q4-update-post-to-round-out-the-year!&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third quarter of 2022 at the Rust Foundation was a unique period that included sowing seeds for exciting developments to come and harvesting the results of long-standing initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, August, and September, the Rust Foundation continued to establish internal policies and practices while evolving with growth in membership, presence at events all over the world, deeper commitments to Project leadership and the Rust community as a whole, and the growth of our team itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the decisions we made over the last quarter were in direct response to feedback from the community. In addition to our broader aims to support and fund the people building and governing the Rust programming language, we will also strive to remain receptive to feedback from both our members and Project leadership to accomplish this mission.We are grateful for all of the honest feedback we received from the community in Q3.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further delay, here are the details of what the Rust Foundation got up to in Q3. Stay tuned for my Q4 update in the coming weeks for more recent developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;staffing-%26-administration&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staffing &amp;amp; Administration&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/q3-2022-update-a-recap-from-rebecca-rumb/#staffing-%26-administration&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the HR groundwork we laid across &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-05-03-a-good-start-to-the-year/&quot;&gt;Q1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-07-27-what-has-the-foundation-been-up-to/&quot;&gt;Q2&lt;/a&gt;, the Foundation team grew significantly in Q3 with the arrival of our new Infrastructure Engineer in September: &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-07-welcome-jan-david-rust-foundation-infrastructure-engineer/&quot;&gt;Jan David&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first engineering hire to be made by the Foundation and we are thrilled to have Jan in the role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan is responsible for the operations of all currently supported and future infrastructure, including managing both existing tools and new development. Jan David will work directly with the Rust Infrastructure team in their daily activities and will help manage the relationship and efforts between that team and the Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hiring process for this position was a close collaboration with Rust Project leaders from application review, to interviews, to the usage of the Applied platform in an effort to remove bias throughout. We were pleased to continue this work at the start of Q4 with additional &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/welcoming-sage-griffin-rust-foundation-communities-advocate/&quot;&gt;Communities Advocate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-10-06-welcome-gracie-gregory-director-of-communications/&quot;&gt;Director of Communications &amp;amp; Marketing&lt;/a&gt; hires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Q3, we also began the work of establishing an upcoming Security Engineer position, which is part of the Rust Foundation’s dedicated Security Initiative &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-13-rust-foundation-establishes-security-team/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in September (underwritten with support from the OpenSSF’s Alpha-Omega Initiative and Rust Foundation Platinum member JFrog). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the security team and its funding was announced raised some concerns about how it was communicated to the Project. Since then, options were discussed for a process to ensure that the Project feels informed and heard before similar announcements are made. We are currently collaboratively drafting a job description based on the feedback we have received from Project leadership and expect to publish the job listing and begin active recruitment soon. We are also actively increasing our communication with the Project beyond just the Security Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;finance-%26-legal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finance &amp;amp; Legal&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/q3-2022-update-a-recap-from-rebecca-rumb/#finance-%26-legal&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Q3, the Foundation generally moved all of its financial and regulatory actions in-house, having spent Q1 &amp;amp; Q2 transitioning away from most third-party consultants that it was previously reliant on before having a full-time Executive Director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foundation also began drafting a full rewrite of the Rust trademark policy, which is a continuation of work that began in 2021. The Foundation is in the process of forming a working group composed of Rust Project leadership and interested Members to ensure that this trademark policy is comprehensive, comprehensible, and in the best interest of the Rust Project, the wider Rust Community, as well as the operations of the Foundation and its members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to have 2-3 trademark policy working group meetings between now and the end of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;membership&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Membership&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/q3-2022-update-a-recap-from-rebecca-rumb/#membership&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platinum-level membership grew in Q3, with the arrival of our newest member &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-06-hello-jfrog/&quot;&gt;JFrog&lt;/a&gt; – an established leader in DevOps. We are thrilled to have JFrog as part of the Platinum tier, which reflects a genuine commitment to supporting the maintenance and development of the Rust programming language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver-level membership also continued to grow in Q3. In September, we were thrilled to welcome &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/tsycapital/about/&quot;&gt;TSY Capital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://matter-labs.io/&quot;&gt;Matter Labs&lt;/a&gt; as our newest Silver Members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation is currently accepting new members across each tier (Platinum/Gold/Silver). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membership benefits include representation on the Board of Directors, marketing and thought leadership related to Rust, and more. To learn more about Rust Foundation membership and inquire, click &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/info/become-a-member/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional membership note: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a 501(c)(6) membership organization, our membership is open to any organization interested in supporting the design, development, or application of the Projects, provided those entities are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Foundation’s Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Membership Application, and other policies. Members within each tier of membership (Silver/Gold/Platinum) are treated equally and are entitled to the same benefits of membership. We understand that there are strong feelings in the community about whether membership and/or benefits to members should be restricted based on additional criteria, however, our membership structure and the legal landscape we must operate within do not provide for that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;community-grants-program&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Grants Program&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/q3-2022-update-a-recap-from-rebecca-rumb/#community-grants-program&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the awarding of our first round of Community Grants in Q2, we have been thrilled to watch grantees get to work on their inspiring and important projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Q3, we began conducting calls with Project Grantees and Fellows to learn what they’ve been working on under the program, what their upcoming goals are, and the type of support they need to continue being successful. These conversations have surfaced many interesting stories. As such, we plan to begin sharing “spotlight” style features on our blog that introduce the Rust community to individual grantees to give others a sense of what the program is like and encourage the celebration of Rust Foundation Fellows and grantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: On October 3, we announced the opening of the second round of applications for the Project Grants program. If you’d like to receive funding for specific packages of work benefitting the Rust Project, we encourage you to apply for a Project Grant by November 7! Learn more &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/project-grants/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;communications-%26-events&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communications &amp;amp; Events&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/q3-2022-update-a-recap-from-rebecca-rumb/#communications-%26-events&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q3 was an exciting time for the Rust community and the Foundation was pleased to help support various events and initiatives during this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, as a sponsor of the event, the Rust Foundation team was excited to attend the 7th annual &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://rustconf.com/&quot;&gt;RustConf&lt;/a&gt; in Portland, Oregon alongside various members of Project leadership. The Rust Foundation hosted a reception on the eve of RustConf’s first day where we were thrilled to see an excellent turnout and many fruitful conversations and connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We heard many positive things about the handling of the remote-attendee experience. We look forward to learning how we can support and develop this and other aspects of the conference in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, the Foundation&#39;s Director of Finance &amp;amp; Funding, Paul Lenz, and I gave a presentation at &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/&quot;&gt;Open Source Summit Europe in Dublin&lt;/a&gt; on funding open source, with the Community Grants Program as a specific example. I was delighted that our session was packed and coupled with many other exciting talks and announcements including the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-13-rust-foundation-establishes-security-team/&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; of Alpha-Omega funding a dedicated Security team at the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September also brought some major Rust-related news that many of us have been waiting for: the arrival of Rust in the Linux Kernel as announced by Linus Torvalds. Though Rust’s presence in the Kernel is still in its early days with just the core infrastructure incorporated, the Foundation sees this as a significant first step in the Rust-Linux relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we kicked off a new series of guest posts on our blog, which are written by members of the Rust Foundation and/or community. We published our first guest post in July via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jondot&quot;&gt;Dotan Nahum&lt;/a&gt;, Founder and CEO of Foundation Silver Member &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectralops.io/&quot;&gt;Spectral&lt;/a&gt;. Find the evolving Rust Foundation Guest Blog series &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/guest%20blog%20series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what%E2%80%99s-next%E2%80%A6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next…&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/q3-2022-update-a-recap-from-rebecca-rumb/#what%E2%80%99s-next%E2%80%A6&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might have gathered, there are many more exciting pertinent updates to share with all of you about Q4 at the Foundation (which is well underway)! Stay tuned over the next few weeks for a recap of our activities in the final quarter of 2022 – and what we’re looking forward to next in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/project-grants/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rust Foundation Project Grants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are part of our larger &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Community Grants Program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They exist to support dedicated packages of work benefitting the Rust programming language – either through Rust-based coding projects or through education/outreach initiatives. You do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; need to be a member of a Rust Project Team or a Working Group and you &lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt; apply as either an individual or as part of a team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grants will be awarded in amounts between $2,500 and $15,000 USD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;%3E%3E-apply-for-a-rust-foundation-project-grant-here&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://app.smarterselect.com/programs/80957-Rust-Foundation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Apply for a Rust Foundation Project Grant here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/project-grants-application-deadline-extended-to-november-7-2022/#%3E%3E-apply-for-a-rust-foundation-project-grant-here&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to AWS, Huawei, and Google for supporting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Community Grants Program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.​​​​​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are we extending the deadline?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team elected to extend the deadline for this program for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we welcomed two new team members to the Rust Foundation over the past few weeks (&lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-10-06-welcome-gracie-gregory-director-of-communications/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gracie Gregory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/project-grants-application-deadline-extended-to-november-7-2022/__notset__&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sage Griffi&lt;/u&gt;n&lt;/a&gt;). Since their work directly impacts the administration of the Project Grants Program, we wanted to ensure they had adequate time to focus on making the application period more navigable and visible to the community. Second, we understand that this is a busy time of year for many of you and additional time to apply for grants like ours is always appreciated. Finally, we’re eager to receive as many applications from the Rust community and hope that this extra week enables more of you to both submit and feel as confident as possible in your application! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your time and interest in receiving a &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/project-grants/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rust Foundation Project Grant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2022-10-21T16:30:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;326&quot; alt=&quot;A graphic stating author&#39;s name (Folkert de Vries) and title (Embedded Software Engineer @ Tweede golf)&quot; title=&quot;Folkert de Vries&quot; src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-10-21-implementing-a-ntp-in-rust/tweede-golf.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to another installment in the Rust Foundation &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/guest%20blog%20series/&quot;&gt;guest blog series&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; written by members of the Rust Foundation and/or community. Today, we are pleased to have a post from Folkert de Vries, Embedded Software Engineer at &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://tweedegolf.nl/en&quot;&gt;Tweede golf &lt;/a&gt;— a Rust Foundation Silver member organization. Read on to learn about how Folkert&#39;s team implemented a Network Time Protocol (NTP) client and server in Rust.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few months, we at &lt;a href=&quot;https://tweedegolf.nl/&quot;&gt;Tweede golf&lt;/a&gt; have been working on implementing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/memorysafety/ntpd-rs&quot;&gt;Network Time Protocol (NTP) client and server in Rust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memorysafety.org/&quot;&gt;Prossimo&lt;/a&gt; initiative and is supported by their sponsors, Cisco and AWS. Our first short-term goal is to deploy our implementation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;, the free, automated, and open certificate authority. The long-term goal is to develop an alternative fully-featured NTP implementation that can be widely used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post we’ll talk about the process of implementing a new open-source version of the protocol in Rust, why an alternative NTP implementation is important, and our experiences along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our project is called ntpd-rs. More information and the initial release of the client can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/memorysafety/ntpd-rs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-ntp%3F&quot;&gt;What is NTP? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/implementing-the-network-time-protocol-ntp-in-rust/#what-is-ntp%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network time protocol synchronizes time between devices connected to a network. Accurate time is essential when your device communicates with other devices, mostly to make sure events are ordered correctly. The device you are reading this article on is probably running an NTP process that regularly synchronizes itself with the real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols, and although it is less known than HTTP or DNS for example, the Internet and its billions of devices depend on it every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clocks in our devices are reasonably accurate, but can drift meaningfully in the space of hours. The real time is kept with atomic clocks. Many technology companies and foundations provide NTP servers that make this time available to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Network_Time_Protocol_servers_and_clients.svg&quot;&gt;This diagram&lt;/a&gt; will give you an idea of the relationships between the various levels of NTP servers.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you ask such a server what time it is, then by the time its response reaches you, that time is out of date. You need to somehow correct for the transmission delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NTP client performs this correction and maintains connections with multiple NTP servers for increased reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/implementing-the-network-time-protocol-ntp-in-rust/#goals&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NTP is part of the foundation of the Internet, and must be absolutely secure and reliable. For example, precise time is used to check TLS certificates– it would be a disaster if an attacker could adjust the system time such that an outdated certificate is seen as valid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary goal for this project is to provide an alternative implementation of NTP, that is just that: secure and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-prossimo-and-the-relevance-of-our-project&quot;&gt;About Prossimo and the relevance of our project &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/implementing-the-network-time-protocol-ntp-in-rust/#about-prossimo-and-the-relevance-of-our-project&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our NTP project fits seamlessly into Prossimo’s objectives. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memorysafety.org/docs/memory-safety/&quot;&gt;Memory safety&lt;/a&gt; is a requirement to achieve a secure implementation of any critical software. Prossimo’s mission states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory safety for the Internet’s most critical infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put: we should provide memory-safe implementations for pieces of software that run the Internet wherever we can. This has materialized in work being done on TLS (Rustls), curl, the Linux kernel, and this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-of-open-source-software&quot;&gt;Security of open source software &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/implementing-the-network-time-protocol-ntp-in-rust/#security-of-open-source-software&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prossimo’s mission has recently attracted more attention since the Linux Foundation project OpenSSF published &lt;a href=&quot;https://openssf.org/oss-security-mobilization-plan/&quot;&gt;The Plan&lt;/a&gt; and selected &lt;em&gt;Memory Safety&lt;/em&gt; as one of ten points of action to improve security of open source software. The plan is backed by open source foundations including &lt;strong&gt;the Rust Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;, the technology industry, as well as the White House. The execution of the memory safety work in The Plan consists in large part of Prossimo projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not dive into all the pros and cons of re-implementations in memory-safe languages here, but we do hope to show that these types of efforts do not need to be lengthy and painful. You can deliver solid results far more quickly than you might think, if you use a programming language like Rust, with its strong ecosystem and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;Rust &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/implementing-the-network-time-protocol-ntp-in-rust/#rust&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Rust for our implementation means that the client we build is memory safe. We don’t do many allocations, but we can be confident that we’ll have no segfaults, buffer overflows or memory leaks ever. The same is true for anyone building on top of our implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of Rust is that we can use its standard library and package ecosystem, so our NTP implementation is much smaller (hence easier to validate) than the alternatives. This small size also makes it easier to play around with extensions to the NTP specification (e.g. in the development of the next version of NTP, NTPv5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice side-effect of our effort is that more people are now familiar with how NTP works, and hopefully our implementation is more accessible. As we noted above, accurate time is crucial for a lot of modern internet infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-experiences&quot;&gt;Our experiences &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/implementing-the-network-time-protocol-ntp-in-rust/#our-experiences&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-protocol&quot;&gt;The protocol &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/implementing-the-network-time-protocol-ntp-in-rust/#the-protocol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We initially struggled with turning the NTP specification text into code. What seems reasonable at a distance becomes painfully imprecise when you actually implement it. Still, after some deliberation, we were ready to get to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of our implementation is a collection of data structures and algorithms that implement the logic of NTP. This part does not do any network calls or clock modification, it just describes as data what calls and modifications are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modeling this core, &lt;code&gt;ntp-proto&lt;/code&gt; as pure functions makes it easily testable, and means we have no unsafe code in this part of the code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our implementation is not a port of the logic of existing implementations ntpd or chrony. In fact, we barely looked at their implementation at all, because we found it hard to map their source code to the NTP specification. Our implementation is based solely on the specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-network&quot;&gt;The network &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/implementing-the-network-time-protocol-ntp-in-rust/#the-network&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our networking requirements go beyond what the Rust standard library provides. NTP uses UDP to send packets, which is well-supported, but we want more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NTP algorithm uses send and receive timestamps, which means we have to know the time right before a packet was sent, and right after it was received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could create these timestamps in our program with &lt;code&gt;Instant::now&lt;/code&gt;, but that time would include the time spent between the socket receiving the message, and our program actually resuming to process the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unix sockets provide more accurate send and receive timestamps. But to get them, we must configure the socket with functions from &lt;code&gt;libc&lt;/code&gt;, which is unsafe and wildly under documented. After lots of digging, we figured out the mechanism, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/pull/2881&quot;&gt;made a tiny contribution to libc&lt;/a&gt;, and implemented a safe &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; version of kernel software timestamping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-clock&quot;&gt;The clock &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/implementing-the-network-time-protocol-ntp-in-rust/#the-clock&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulating the system clock is not exposed by the standard library, so here too we must drop down to &lt;code&gt;libc&lt;/code&gt;. Luckily we had some experience with manipulating the clock on Linux from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/72/announcing-statime-a-rust-ptp-implementation&quot;&gt;Precision Time Protocol project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-system&quot;&gt;The system &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/implementing-the-network-time-protocol-ntp-in-rust/#the-system&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above components are combined in what NTP calls the “system”: it orchestrates how the NTP daemon interacts with the outside world and the system clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system relies on Rust’s &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; support and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tokio.rs/&quot;&gt;tokio&lt;/a&gt; async runtime. We use &lt;code&gt;clap&lt;/code&gt; to define our command-line interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing C solutions need to build concurrency, argument parsing and other basic functionality from scratch. Having no dependencies brings distribution advantages, but has serious downsides in terms of lines of code and maintainability. Verifying memory safety and other security properties in such a big code base is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust, checking properties of the system is much easier: memory safety is guaranteed by the compiler, and the standard library and many of the popular libraries have undergone serious security scrutiny. Our code, and by extension the work involved in security reviews, is comparatively small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/implementing-the-network-time-protocol-ntp-in-rust/#conclusion&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we had a handle on NTP’s core ideas, development went smoothly. Setting up all the other parts, networking, clock adjustment and the asynchronous tasks, was a joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our smooth experience strengthens us in the conviction that Rust is the correct choice for projects of this type: all of the protocol logic is completely safe, and only when we interact directly with the OS do we need to reason about unsafe code. We start the subsequent phases of the project with confidence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our code is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/memorysafety/ntpd-rs&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for reading this post in the Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/guest%20blog%20series/&quot;&gt;guest blog series&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned for more installments in the future!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/welcoming-sage-griffin-rust-foundation-communities-advocate/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;&quot;&gt;  &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/welcoming-sage-griffin-rust-foundation-communities-advocate/#&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-10-19-welcoming-sage-griffin/sage.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;welcome-to-sage-griffin-%E2%80%94-our-new-communities-advocate!&quot;&gt;Welcome to Sage Griffin — our new Communities Advocate! &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/welcoming-sage-griffin-rust-foundation-communities-advocate/#welcome-to-sage-griffin-%E2%80%94-our-new-communities-advocate!&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation could not adequately support the Rust programming language and the maintainers developing the project without a strong focus on community health and collaboration. For this reason, we’ve been seeking to fill a significant role at the Foundation for several months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re thrilled to share that Sage Griffin has joined the Rust Foundation as our first Communities Advocate. Sage uses they/them pronouns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sage has previously worked as a co-lead of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;crates.io&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; team, hosted several software development discussion podcasts, created &lt;a href=&quot;http://diesel.rs/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;diesel.rs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and served as the Program Committee Lead for RustConf in the past. You might also recognize Sage as a moderator on numerous &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-11-04-rust-foundation-ama-launch/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ask Me Anything&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sessions we’ve held between Foundation staff and board members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this position, Sage will be responsible for developing and managing positive, productive communication between the Rust Project and user communities, and the Foundation. Sage will also serve as a liaison between Rust Project Teams and Working Groups to stay up to date with current activities and champion current and new initiatives. In short, the Communities Advocate role will be central to achieving our shared and ongoing goal of sustaining, securing, and growing the Rust language. We couldn’t be happier to have Sage at the helm of this mission-critical position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their own words on the Communities Advocate role, Sage says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;As a former full time open source contributor, I know how painful it can be to seek funding as an individual. That’s why I truly care about the Foundation’s mission to help serve the Rust community. But as an outsider, I see areas for improved communication and trust between the Foundation and the project. As Communities Advocate, I hope to maintain existing lines of communication, establish new healthy ones, and do my part to ensure the Foundation is doing what’s best for the Rust project and community.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sage will regularly work with the Rust Foundation team, the Rust Project Teams and Working Groups, individual maintainers, and the wider Rust communities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Rust Foundation, Sage!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;280&quot; alt=&quot;Headshot of Gracie&quot; src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-10-06-welcome-gracie-gregory-director-of-communications/gracie.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;welcome-to-gracie-gregory%2C-our-new-director-of-communications-and-marketing!&quot;&gt;Welcome to Gracie Gregory, our new Director of Communications and Marketing! &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-10-06-welcome-gracie-gregory-director-of-communications/#welcome-to-gracie-gregory%2C-our-new-director-of-communications-and-marketing!&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation exists to steward the Rust programming language, which means supporting maintainers, providing infrastructure, and nurturing growth, adoption and innovation in the Rust ecosystem. A key part of our work is to tell the story of Rust - why the language is awesome, how inclusive and passionate the community is, and what great things are being done with Rust all over the world. Being able to tell this story enables us to promote Rust more effectively, communicate with the global Rust communities and our Members and supporters, fundraise to support Rust’s development and leverage greater resources into the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After months of careful consideration, the Rust Foundation is pleased to announce a new addition to the Senior Management Team – Gracie Gregory who has come aboard as the Foundation’s new Director of Communications and Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her new role, Gracie is dedicated to developing and managing strategic communications with the Rust communities, and with Rust enthusiasts and adopters across the world. She is responsible for creating and executing the Rust Foundation’s marketing and communications strategy, with a focus on engaging with the Rust communities, expanding Foundation membership, promoting the use and benefits of the Rust programming language, and championing the interests of the Rust Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was important to us at the Foundation to bring someone experienced into this role, who had a passion for open source communications and community engagement and we found this in Gracie. In a previous position at the Linux Foundation, Gracie collaborated with training and certification, and events teams, as well as with senior leadership and the wider Linux community. She has also worked closely with engineers, open source maintainers, and tech communities in previous content creation and communications roles at Stackery (now part of AWS), and Forem – the open source software behind popular developer community &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.to/&quot;&gt;dev.to&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Gracie served as Program Chair of CodeNewbie’s CodeLand conference for the past three years. In short, Gracie has worked throughout her career in tech to connect with developer audiences through authentic and carefully-researched storytelling, and we are thrilled to have her on board. On her new role, Gracie said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m sincerely honored to have been brought on as the Rust Foundation’s new Director of Communications &amp;amp; Marketing. I believe that a strong communications strategy must be built with a focus on benefitting its recipients – in the case of the Rust Foundation, that includes our members (present and future), brilliant maintainers, and the next generation of Rust talent. The only way for us to achieve this will be for me to listen to the Rust community with the intent to learn from them. I can’t wait to help tell fascinating stories about the Rust project and those using it to build things that will improve the world around us – with the support of the Foundation behind them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch this space for lots of new content. We expect Gracie to be reaching out to a lot of you very soon!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Rust Foundation Project Grants are open for applications</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-10-03-project-grants-open-for-applications/"/>
		<updated>2022-10-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-10-03-project-grants-open-for-applications/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: The 2022 application deadline for the second round of Project Grants has been &lt;strong&gt;extended to November 7, 2022&lt;/strong&gt; @ 11:59 PM PDT. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation is delighted to announce that its Project Grants Program is now open for a second round of applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/project-grants&quot;&gt;Rust Foundation Project Grants&lt;/a&gt; are financial awards that support specific packages of work that benefit the Rust Project directly or provide Rust education/outreach. You can apply for a grant as an individual, or as part of a team, and request between $2,500 and $15,000 USD. Ideally the work should be carried out within six months of the award being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any work that benefits the Rust Project or Rust education/outreach is eligible for a Project Grant. Priority will be given to those grants that will clearly deliver a significant benefit to a reasonable proportion of the Rust community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like the Rust Foundation Grants Program to be as open and accessible as possible, and realise that some may find the application form and questions daunting. As such, we would like to give prospective grantees whatever support they might need through this process in completing an application. If you have any questions about the grants, are unsure whether you should apply, or would like help in completing an application, please get in touch. You can:&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Member Spotlight: Keyrock</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-27-member-spotlight-keyrock/"/>
		<updated>2022-09-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-27-member-spotlight-keyrock/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-09-27-member-spotlight-keyrock/member-spotlight-keyrock.jpg&quot; width=&quot;602&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our latest Member Spotlight blog! Jeremy de Groodt, CTO and Co-Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://keyrock.eu/&quot;&gt;Keyrock&lt;/a&gt;, talked to us about their work and how they’re using Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-you-join-the-rust-foundation%3F-what-are-you-hoping-to-get-out-of-your-membership-in-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;Why did you join the Rust Foundation? What are you hoping to get out of your membership in the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-27-member-spotlight-keyrock/#why-did-you-join-the-rust-foundation%3F-what-are-you-hoping-to-get-out-of-your-membership-in-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Keyrock, we have been very invested in Rust technology for about 2.5 years now. Rustaceans are a tightly knit community and very early on it was clear to us it is in our DNA to give back to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an algorithmic trading market maker in the digital assets field, we operate in a niche not many people are aware of. We stand at the intersection of DLT and Finance and we strongly believe that the tokenization of digital assets will change the world as we know it, for the better. For us to be able to achieve the grand vision of democratizing liquidity services at scale, to foster this wave of technological innovation, we are convinced we can only achieve it by being able to rely on a robust technological foundation, and one that can withstand scale and the intensity of 24/7 operations. Having realized this early on and having had the luck to be able to explore Rust technology with some of our team members at an early stage of our growth, we not only want to be more visible on the scene and connect to developers who also love Rust and solve similar problems to us. We also want to build a powerful bridge of collaboration by evangelizing “RustFi” as a sub-niche. We strongly believe the use of Rust as a Web3 financial technology driver will be the essential building stone for the future, and being able to share our story and meet like-minded Rustaceans is the main reason for us to join the Rust Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-you-choose-rust-for-your-particular-application-or-use-case%3F&quot;&gt;Why did you choose Rust for your particular application or use case? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-27-member-spotlight-keyrock/#why-did-you-choose-rust-for-your-particular-application-or-use-case%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust was created building on the learnings of the development community gathered while using other programming languages for the last 40 years. It keeps certain desired characteristics of a low-level language - speed - while also adding safety on top: it will not compile unless the code is correct. This made Rust the best, most optimal choice in our view as a foundational language of our complex, distributed trading systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-your-predictions-for-the-rust-language-and-%2F-or-rust-community-over-the-next-18-months%3F&quot;&gt;What are your predictions for the Rust language and / or Rust community over the next 18 months? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-27-member-spotlight-keyrock/#what-are-your-predictions-for-the-rust-language-and-%2F-or-rust-community-over-the-next-18-months%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly speaking - broader commercial adoption, especially in the financial industry. We see it already rapidly taking up the share of C++ as more and more companies transition to Rust and we believe this trend will only continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-advice-would-you-give-to-developers-who-are-considering-using-rust%3F&quot;&gt;What advice would you give to developers who are considering using Rust? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-27-member-spotlight-keyrock/#what-advice-would-you-give-to-developers-who-are-considering-using-rust%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be humble, patient and do not get discouraged while learning. We see many inexperienced developers writing Rust in similar ways to different languages while in fact it has its own very distinct ways and requires a different approach to solving problems while using Rust. Keep an open mind and accept that the Rust learning curve is as steep as “El Capitan” ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend to everyone interested in Rust this series of articles by one of our early joiners, Rust advocate and current VP Product of Keyrock, Kushal Joshi: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/kushalj/18-factors-powering-the-rust-revolution-part-1-of-3-3imc&quot;&gt;https://dev.to/kushalj/18-factors-powering-the-rust-revolution-part-1-of-3-3imc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-say-to-the-crypto-naysayers%2C-the-folks-who-might-consider-keyrock-a-crypto-scam-business%3F-how-is-keyrock-different-from-some-of-the-companies-or-stories-our-community-might-be-concerned-about%3F&quot;&gt;What do you say to the crypto naysayers, the folks who might consider Keyrock a crypto scam business? How is Keyrock different from some of the companies or stories our community might be concerned about? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-27-member-spotlight-keyrock/#what-do-you-say-to-the-crypto-naysayers%2C-the-folks-who-might-consider-keyrock-a-crypto-scam-business%3F-how-is-keyrock-different-from-some-of-the-companies-or-stories-our-community-might-be-concerned-about%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand the frustration and concerns of many. After having been more than 5 years active in the industry, we can say we have seen a lot of things happen and still see passing by. Technological innovation is more often than not accompanied by those who want to take shortcuts or take advantage from misinformation, and builders that create a problem to a solution. The world has seen it happen in the past, and it will happen in the future. More than ever we realize that cyclical trends are there for a reason – a cycle of adoption, learning, experimentation, quality filters and evangelization, followed by one of blunt mistakes, greed, immaturity, lack of substance and dishonesty. Many actors join, many actors leave. We welcome it. We do believe more than ever, the industry as a whole is at a stage where the actors, talent, technological entrepreneur spirit, adoption and maturity is so developed, the next few years will be incredibly exciting to follow and be part of. Our conviction is sound and we are not the only ones. To anyone who is familiar with the ecosystem it is very clear Keyrock is a financial entity that is not just a market neutral and agnostic infrastructure player, it is moreover an essential part in the adoption cycle of healthy, efficient and fair tokenized economies. By providing liquidity services, at scale, to the founders and developers of the future, we not only create the financial foundation for these economies to be built on, they can also thrive and promote adoption in a fair manner. We are not reinventing the wheel, as market makers have been around for years in traditional finance; we are just building it to be adapted to democratized financial markets. At scale, 24/7, from the ground up and robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us the logical rule of engagement with any entity is to follow strict due diligence practices to make sure we do not engage with anyone who practices market abuse. We never engage in any malpractices like market manipulation for either our own or our partners’ gain. Early on, we made investment in regulatory affairs, speaking closely with the governments and financial regulators of many global jurisdictions by appointing a Head of Compliance, which hopefully shows our dedication to operating with integrity. We are also in the process of applying for licenses in the UK and Belgium, which will put us at the forefront of globally regulated, crypto-native financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-your-product-or-service%2C-specifically%3F-can-you-describe-it-in-more-specific-terms-than-the-foundation-on-top-of-which-token-economies-thrive-or-digital-assets-are-built%3F&quot;&gt;What is your product or service, specifically? Can you describe it in more specific terms than the foundation on top of which token economies thrive or digital assets are built? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-27-member-spotlight-keyrock/#what-is-your-product-or-service%2C-specifically%3F-can-you-describe-it-in-more-specific-terms-than-the-foundation-on-top-of-which-token-economies-thrive-or-digital-assets-are-built%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our core service is market making, also called liquidity provision. In simple terms, by constantly, algorithmically quoting buy and sell prices of digital assets on multiple markets and for multiple tokens, we make markets liquid for regular buyers and sellers - it enables them to transact easily, at any time, at a fair market price, which is an attractive and healthy attribute on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to refine our solutions and make liquidity accessible to as many clients as possible as we believe it will create the financial foundation for tokenized economies to be built on.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Rust Foundation Establishes Security Team to Support and Advance Rust Programming Language</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-13-rust-foundation-establishes-security-team/"/>
		<updated>2022-09-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-13-rust-foundation-establishes-security-team/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN, September 13, 2022 - The Rust Foundation, the nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting and sustaining the Rust programming language, today announced it is establishing a dedicated security team. The team is being underwritten with generous support from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/&quot;&gt;OpenSSF’s Alpha-Omega Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, which partners with open source software projects and maintainers to improve the global software supply chain security, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jfrog.com/blog/jfrog-joins-rust-foundation-as-platinum-member/&quot;&gt;Rust Foundation’s newest Platinum member JFrog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s often a misperception that because Rust ensures memory safety that it’s one hundred percent secure, but Rust can be vulnerable just like any other language and warrants proactive measures to protect and sustain it and the community,” said Bec Rumbul, Executive Director at the Rust Foundation. “With the establishment of the Rust Foundation Security Team, we will be able to support the broader Rust community with the highest-level of security talent and help ensure the reliability of Rust for everyone. Of course, this is just a start. We hope to continue to build out the team in the coming months and years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These investments from Alpha-Omega and JFrog include dedicated staff resources that will enable the Rust Foundation to create and implement security best practices. The first initiative for the new Security Team will be to undertake a security audit and threat modeling exercises to identify how security can be economically maintained going forward. The team will also help advocate for security practices across the Rust landscape, including Cargo and &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt;, and will be a resource for the maintainer community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpenSSF suggested in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://openssf.org/oss-security-mobilization-plan/&quot;&gt;10-Point Open Source Security Mobilization Plan&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year that the industry work to eliminate root causes of many vulnerabilities through the replacement of non-memory-safe languages with Rust and Go. As a result, the OpenSSF’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/&quot;&gt;Alpha-Omega Initiative&lt;/a&gt; has made a grant to the Rust Foundation to support a dedicated security engineer. Alpha-Omega is funded by Google and Microsoft with a mission of direct engagement to improve the security of OSS projects. “We’re learning how to turn money into security,” said Michael Winser and Michael Scovetta, co-directors of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rust programming language shows great promise for a more secure global supply chain, and the Rust Foundation is the home for this work,” said Brian Behlendorf, GM, OpenSSF. “We are looking forward to seeing the Rust Foundation’s Security Team get started and collaborating on this important work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JFrog just last week announced it is joining the Rust Foundation at the Platinum level. As part of the company’s investment in the Rust Foundation and ecosystem, JFrog has committed members of its Security Research team to work on the Rust Foundation Security Team. JFrog joins AWS, Google, Huawei, Meta, Microsoft, and Mozilla at the Platinum level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rust Foundation provides the forum for collaboration among all Rust stakeholders and is the natural home for a dedicated security team,” said Stephen Chin, VP of Developer Relations, JFrog. “We believe it’s the responsibility of all of us who use Rust to contribute resources for the greater good of the community, and providing world class researchers from the JFrog Security team is one of the ways we are supporting the Rust ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Welcome Jan David: Rust Foundation Infrastructure Engineer</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-07-welcome-jan-david-rust-foundation-infrastructure-engineer/"/>
		<updated>2022-09-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-07-welcome-jan-david-rust-foundation-infrastructure-engineer/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-09--07-welcome-infra-engineer-jan-david/jandavid.jpg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust, of course, is a great, open source programming language. Did you know, however, that there is a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes to ensure that it stays great? A dedicated group of maintainers, teams and community members work tirelessly to improve and grow the Rust Project every day. One area where this is especially true is the work that keeps the lights on for the Rust Project itself. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/infra&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Infrastructure Team&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; supports and manages the infrastructure that allows Rust to be released, the compiler to be built and tested, the documentation to be generated and made publicly available, and so much more. This small, all-volunteer team both reacts to acute issues as well as strategically works to make the Project faster and more efficient in its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining infrastructure for the Rust Project is a lot of work, and it is important to reiterate that this has been done by volunteers, on their own time. Some months ago, the Infrastructure Team approached the Foundation to ask whether it could provide support. After some thought about how best the Foundation could help, and understanding how much work and responsibility there is for the Infrastructure Team, it was decided that having a dedicated, full-time engineer was the best course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foundation is excited to welcome Jan David as its first engineering hire, here to directly support Rust Project and other Rust related Infrastructure. Jan David is responsible for the operations of all currently supported and future infrastructure, including managing both existing tools and new development. Jan David will work directly with the Rust Infrastructure team in their daily activities and will help manage the relationship and efforts between that team and the Foundation. In Jan David&#39;s own words...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s been impressive to learn about the work that the infrastructure team has done, and the efforts they have put in on a voluntary basis. I am very excited about joining the Rust Foundation to support the team and the Rust community, and look forward to helping continue the tradition of providing awesome infrastructure for Rust and its projects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the Infrastructure Team for all of their efforts in ensuring that Rust is a world-class, open source project.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Hello JFrog!</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-06-hello-jfrog/"/>
		<updated>2022-09-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-06-hello-jfrog/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation is delighted to announce that JFrog has joined the Foundation as a Platinum Member. JFrog is a respected world-leader and innovator in devops, redefining the way developers build, secure, manage and distribute software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Platinum tier of membership is the highest tier available, and reflects genuine investment in, and commitment to, supporting the maintenance and development of the Rust programming language. Platinum Membership includes a Member Director position on the Rust Foundation Board of Directors, and this enables the Foundation to benefit from the knowledge, expertise and experience of its members in managing the Foundation’s vision and strategy. The Rust Foundation is delighted that Stephen Chin, VP of Developer Relations at JFrog, will become Member Director for JFrog on the Board of Directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussing JFrog’s motivation to join the Rust Foundation, Chin said “JFrog’s vision is to streamline software releases from code to production regardless of language. Rust is the most beloved language of software developers and is the most asked for package type by our customers. As a result, we are making big investments in Rust, which powers Pyrsia, our new open source supply chain security project. Joining the Rust Foundation is yet another way we can help to grow this amazing language ecosystem.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Rumbul, Executive Director &amp;amp; CEO of the Rust Foundation welcomed the news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that JFrog has joined us at the Rust Foundation as a Platinum Member. Rust is a fast growing language with a bright future, and investment by leading global businesses such as JFrog in supporting Rust’s development is key to unlocking that future. Stephen Chin brings to the Board of Directors a wealth of experience and a deep commitment to the values of the Rust community, and we are excited to begin this partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Trademark Policy: Review and Survey</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-08-09-trademark-policy-review-and-survey/"/>
		<updated>2022-08-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-08-09-trademark-policy-review-and-survey/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For some time there has been an acknowledged need, both within the Foundation and amongst Rust users, to update the Rust Foundation trademark policy to ensure that it is fit for purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark law is primarily about protecting the public, rather than the holder of the trademark. Trademarks represent a specific product or service, and the values and qualities associated with it. This means that the use of trademarks that confuse people - in our case the community of maintainers, developers and wider users of the Rust programming language - is not legally permitted. The Rust Foundation, as the steward of the Rust and Cargo trademarks, must ensure that the marks are used properly, so that the community is not confused or encouraged to use a different or inferior product to what they expect. When the trademark no longer represents a trusted level of quality to the community, the trademark loses its value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust and Cargo names and brands make it possible to say what is officially part of the Rust community, and what isn’t. So we need to be careful about where we allow them to appear. But at the same time, we want to allow for as much creative use of these brands as we can - this is open source after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we would like your help to inform us how we should strike the right balance as we review and redraft the trademark policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/rust-foundation-trademark-survey/&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; should only take around 5 minutes to complete, and will enable us to better understand what you, the community, want from the trademark policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have your answers, a group of Project members, Foundation staff and legal counsel will meet to review the results, discuss key principles and ways forward, and provide guidance on what should be in our revised policy. Our legal counsel will then produce a final policy, which we hope will be in place by year end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/rust-foundation-trademark-survey/&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; will be open until 2nd September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/rust-foundation-trademark-survey/&quot;&gt;TAKE THE SURVEY HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate your support!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Can you help us improve software supply chain integrity practices?</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-07-29-can-you-help-us-improve-software-supply-chain-integrity-practices/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Security is always important in building software. However, security in OSS is higher on the agenda than ever before. Governments around the world are finally beginning to recognise that OSS is an integral part of digital infrastructure, and are asking how it can be effectively safeguarded. At the Rust Foundation, we want to contribute to that conversation, work collaboratively with others, and understand how we can support good, secure and sustainable OSS in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new survey by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chainguard.dev/&quot;&gt;Chainguard&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with the Eclipse Foundation, the Rust Foundation and OpenSSF aims to understand the software supply chain integrity practices of a broad range of software professionals. The goal of this survey is to learn more about how software professionals use and view key software supply chain integrity practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This survey is intended for professionals involved in the creation and maintenance of software. The survey should only take 5 to 10 minutes to complete. Your responses will be used to gain insights that will improve software supply chain security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first 500 responses, Chainguard will also make a $10 contribution per response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outreachy.org/&quot;&gt;Outreachy&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that helps underrepresented groups find internships in open source and open science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoQj2lzGIaDJ3-uVBxble6YjaElAreTO1LLaQ7Ws2XwrosXQ/viewform&quot;&gt;You can take the survey here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate your support! The survey results will be made available via a public whitepaper this December.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Q2 2022 Update: What has the Foundation been up to?</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-07-27-what-has-the-foundation-been-up-to/"/>
		<updated>2022-07-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-07-27-what-has-the-foundation-been-up-to/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have officially passed the 2022 half-way mark, and I wanted to provide an update on what we have been doing internally within the Foundation during the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short — we have been quite busy. Over the past three months, we have built significantly on the work of Q1, continuing to build our internal administrative, financial and legal processes, and finalizing the migration of a lot of functions previously managed by consultants into the Foundation. Alongside this, we have been trying to deliver on real programs of work externally, such as Cloud Compute and the Community Grants Program, that will benefit Rust maintainers. As a new organization, we continue to reflect on how we have done things and how we can improve them in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staffing &amp;amp; Administration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much of the initial HR set up was conducted in Q1, many policies and procedures remained to be developed, in particular concerning the standardization of recruitment practices. Q2 saw the first fully open recruitment exercise conducted by the Foundation executive for an Infrastructure Engineer — a position identified as much-needed by the Infra Team. The Foundation worked with Project leaders to sift applications and conduct first round interviews, and used the Applied platform to try to remove bias in the process. Recruitment is incredibly time-consuming, and we were very grateful to the Project Leaders involved for participating in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a lot of feedback on the process, in particular around encouraging diverse candidates, advertising salary bands, accommodating candidates that are not neurotypical, and being more transparent about contract details, and we are trying to figure out how we might incorporate or action that feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finance &amp;amp; Legal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the financial and regulatory actions needed to keep the Foundation ticking over were previously contracted out before we had a full time ED and staff. In Q1 and Q2 we worked on migrating responsibility for these things from previous consultants to the Foundation. This gives us more power over our own affairs, it makes us much more agile, and is much better value for money. The disentanglement of functions and accounts was a challenging undertaking, as much of the data could not simply be transferred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark registration continued, with successful registrations in Russia, UK, EU, Belarus, New Zealand and Taiwan. Further Trademark focused work is required in the near future, including a full rewrite of the Trademark policy. This work was paused last year, but the recent discussions on some trademark issues demonstrate that we should develop something more comprehensive, rather than continuing to update the current policy as bugs arise. We hope to involve interested members of the community to work on this with us very soon in Q3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Membership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver level membership continued to grow in Q2, with three new members joining. We are excited that we are currently talking to three new Platinum Member candidates, and we are working hard to bring those organizations on board fully in Q3. New memberships are not only exciting in that they demonstrate just how popular Rust is, but vital to our growth and sustainability. A large and diverse membership means more expertise is available to us, there is greater potential for collaboration, and importantly, diversification of our funding means we are more financially secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a 501(c)(6) membership organization, our membership is open to any organization interested in supporting the design, development, or application of the Projects, provided those entities are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Foundation’s Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Membership Application, and other policies. Members within each tier of membership (Silver/Gold/Platinum) are treated equally and are entitled to the same benefits of membership. We understand that there are strong feelings in the community about whether membership and/or benefits to members should be restricted based on additional criteria, however our membership structure and the legal landscape we must operate within does not provide for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Grants Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were delighted to complete the application, assessment and award of the first round of the Community Grants Program between April and the end of June. We originally thought that the Program was going to take 2-3 months longer to deliver, so we are pleased that financial support is in place earlier than expected. The administration associated with the Program occupied a significant volume of staff time in Q2, including conducting initial sifts and assessments, conducting calls with applicants, verifying details and coordinating input. Assessments were conducted on over 60 applications, and this process included soliciting expert views from Project leaders and team members, who provided valuable and much-appreciated feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We feel that the Program has gone well, however we know that there is room for improvement in future iterations. We are already beginning to think about how we might make positive changes to the 2023 Program, and we are beginning to fundraise to ensure we can fund it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communications &amp;amp; Events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of good news for Rust during Q2 — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slashdata.co/free-resources/state-of-the-developer-nation-22nd-edition&quot;&gt;SlashData&lt;/a&gt; reported that Rust usage had nearly quadrupled over 24 months to April 2022, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; report once again identified Rust as ‘Most Loved’ language, with it sharing first place with Python on the ‘Most Wanted’ list for the first time. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/23/linus_torvalds_rust_linux_kernel/&quot;&gt;comments made by Linus Torvalds&lt;/a&gt; teasing Rust in the Linux kernel’s next release also turned a lot of heads, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openssf.org/oss-security-mobilization-plan/&quot;&gt;OpenSSF report&lt;/a&gt; on mobilizing OSS security names Rust as a key potential tool in making the internet more secure. It is really great to see industry media picking up these and other positive stories about Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended the Linux Foundation OSS Summit in June, and felt that it was a useful and educational event. There were a lot of sessions where I got to learn about how other OSS Projects and Foundations operate and how they tackle common issues. Importantly, I got to have individual conversations with people genuinely interested in supporting OSS effectively, I met with current and potential members of the Rust Foundation, and other bodies looking to potentially support the great work we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began quite a few exciting conversations about collaborative projects, memberships, new in-kind resources and new funding in recent weeks, and over the next few months we are going to be working on making these ideas and possibilities a reality. We are trying to build on the political momentum behind security in OSS to identify how we can work with our members to support security in Rust, we are going to be working on updating our Trademark Policy, which we will consult on publicly shortly, we will be attending a few more events to meet more of our fellow Rustaceans (including the OSS Summit Europe, where we will be speaking about the Rust Foundation), and we will be opening applications for Project Grants from the Community Grants Fund in the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Making a Career Move with Rust: A Developer’s Approach</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-06-21-guest-blog-series-dotan-nahum/"/>
		<updated>2022-06-21T17:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-06-21-guest-blog-series-dotan-nahum/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-06-21-guest-blog-series/dotan-nahum.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dotan Nahum&quot; title=&quot;Dotan Nahum - Founder and CEO, Spectral&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the first post in our Rust Foundation &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/guest%20blog%20series/&quot;&gt;guest blog series&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; written by members of the Rust Foundation and/or community. Today, we are pleased to have a post from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jondot&quot;&gt;Dotan Nahum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Founder and CEO of Foundation silver member &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spectralops.io/&quot;&gt;Spectral&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Read on to learn about making a career move with Rust, from a developer point of view.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have a career in Rust. That said, the most important thing to know is that Rust is still a relatively young programming language. For example, if you come across Rust job openings that require 10 years experience, or even 5 years &amp;quot;production&amp;quot; experience, it might be that these posts were written by &amp;quot;converting&amp;quot; some Java or C++ roles to their Rust counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that companies just don&#39;t know how to hire Rust developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, just as candidates sometimes don&#39;t pass interviews, companies aren’t always equipped to &lt;em&gt;conduct&lt;/em&gt; a strong interview. For example, some companies may not have enough of a technical foundation to give you a proper Rust interview, and a smart thing to do as a candidate is to ask the employer how employees are learning to become experts at the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing to remember is that other than the usual backend, infrastructure, and systems programming areas Rust is widely known for, it has also been dominant in the cryptocurrency world. There are many crypto oriented &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-in-blockchain/awesome-blockchain-rust&quot;&gt;open source projects&lt;/a&gt; to learn from, which is fantastic. Not by chance, the number of open Rust jobs in crypto currently outnumber those in other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, when a programming language is relatively new and is not dominating a market, there will naturally be less focus on the language itself during the interview. Instead there will be a focus on pure programming experience, software design, and common sense, which I think is a good thing. This means candidates&#39; overall engineering skills can be the main focus of the interview, versus their ability to memorize some esoteric programming language feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-may-not-have-to-look-for-a-new-job&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may not have to look for a new job&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-06-21-guest-blog-series-dotan-nahum/#you-may-not-have-to-look-for-a-new-job&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes not switching jobs is the smartest thing to do if you can promote Rust in your current company. You can do this by convincing decision makers to understand the value of Rust. Then you can propose Rust be used for a new project or to replace parts of your existing codebase. In these cases, the areas where introducing Rust will have the most impact and be the most efficient investment include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance critical bits, which you&#39;ll want to replace but still tie those to your existing Node.js, Go, Ruby, Python or other codebases. You can do that with &lt;a href=&quot;https://neon-bindings.com/&quot;&gt;Neon&lt;/a&gt; (Node.js), &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectralops.io/blog/rust-vs-go-why-not-use-both/&quot;&gt;ffi&lt;/a&gt; (Go), &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danielpclark/rutie#using-rust-in-ruby&quot;&gt;Rutie&lt;/a&gt; (Ruby, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tildeio/helix&quot;&gt;Helix&lt;/a&gt; used to be popular too), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3&quot;&gt;pyo3&lt;/a&gt; (Python).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another area which has great potential is CLI utilities. There&#39;s already a vast array of high quality tools built in Rust such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep&quot;&gt;ripgrep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dandavison/delta&quot;&gt;delta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sharkdp/bat&quot;&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; and more. Chances are your colleagues already use some of these, so building tools for your own company would seem just natural. After all, there&#39;s a good reason these tools were written in Rust, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-if-i&#39;m-coming-from-backend-or-web%3F&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I&#39;m coming from backend or Web?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-06-21-guest-blog-series-dotan-nahum/#what-if-i&#39;m-coming-from-backend-or-web%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from Web and services can be the hardest to justify in terms of moving to Rust. Often, the &amp;quot;competition&amp;quot;, such as your go-to Node.js and React stack, is just too big (e.g. ecosystem) and too valuable (e.g. sharing code between backend and frontend) to beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While frameworks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yewstack/yew&quot;&gt;yew&lt;/a&gt; will feel great for developers who build React based apps, yew is still a niche framework which is not as widely adopted or sought-after as your typical React and Typescript stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arewewebyet.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Are we Web yet?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get inspired for where to start and what to look for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, wasm (Web Assembly) specific use cases are taking off. Checking out how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt; is using Rust is shockingly inspiring. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/webassembly/&quot;&gt;wasm category&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Are we Web yet?&lt;/em&gt; is particularly exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&#39;s a lot of hope still. Tooling and infrastructure for the web is taking off in Rust. Examples are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rome/tools&quot;&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; (built by Facebook/Meta), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swc-project/swc&quot;&gt;swc&lt;/a&gt; which aim to replace Babel, eslint, and similar tools completely, and you can be sure it&#39;s jaw-dropping fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust is a great candidate when building simple APIs or APIs with a specific requirement for performance, safety and simplicity that do one thing well. These include download or upload handlers, image resizing, fast A/B testing APIs, mission-critical and latency sensitive APIs, and more. This is why you&#39;ll find Rust jobs in CDN and cloud infrastructure companies, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/rust/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sweet spots can revolve around real-time processing of data: text, audio, streaming, as well as resource-constrained services in an environment such as IoT or cost-sensitive server farm processing. Cryptography is another category where Rust brings a lot of value over other programming languages. You&#39;ll find your typical cloud providers such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1639811/software-development-engineer-rust&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; with these kinds of Rust jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;i&#39;m-coming-from-c%2B%2B&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&#39;m coming from C++&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-06-21-guest-blog-series-dotan-nahum/#i&#39;m-coming-from-c%2B%2B&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C++ devs enjoy an easy bridging of their mental model of Rust and C++. And so it&#39;s natural to first start finding Rust jobs inside their company, as many explore transitioning C++ codebases to Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another direction to look at is crypto and trading. Where the intuition for low overhead and zero-cost will be highly appreciated. While gaming is not completely taken over by Rust, the speed at which Rust is growing within the gaming ecosystem is amazing. Stockholm-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.embark-studios.com/&quot;&gt;Embark&lt;/a&gt; is famous for adopting and advocating Rust and is worth &lt;a href=&quot;https://embark.dev/&quot;&gt;following&lt;/a&gt;. Either way, I recommend exploring &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad&quot;&gt;macroquad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bevyengine.org/&quot;&gt;Bevy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;i&#39;m-coming-from-infrastructure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&#39;m coming from infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-06-21-guest-blog-series-dotan-nahum/#i&#39;m-coming-from-infrastructure&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Go dominates infrastructure jobs, as thinking about Cloud-Native is almost the same as thinking about Go, Rust is growing in these areas as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto (blockchain), as a domain, has a lot of Rust. Depending on your interest areas, this may be very appealing and it&#39;s very well-known that there are a lot of openings for hiring Rust developers in this domain. Since crypto is thriving, this is one application that does need &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of infrastructure, and it needs to be cost effective, as well as secure and accurate: all natural spots for Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing python utilities and infrastructure is already a popular thing to do. Python is a perfect target for this because many times it&#39;s used for data processing and analysis, and that&#39;s how a company starts: a smart ML model and a horrible UI slapped over it -- and that&#39;s a good thing (MVPs and all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that company grows, and if it happens fast, it&#39;s most probably they&#39;ll keep using Python for everything, including Web services, infrastructure, and tooling -- and that will create a lot of bottlenecks. This naturally happens when you use the same tool for everything. Rust found a sweet spot in these kinds of companies replacing these kinds of workloads, being used to optimize hot paths, most often with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3&quot;&gt;pyo3&lt;/a&gt;. Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ijl/orjson&quot;&gt;one example&lt;/a&gt; of this in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-start%3F&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I start?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-06-21-guest-blog-series-dotan-nahum/#how-do-i-start%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common knowledge that Rust is hard to learn, or that it has a steep learning curve, is actually less true today. Granted, it has a different mental model than most modern languages-- but it does have a &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; mental model; this means that if you think about how programming languages work, and how computers work, Rust will make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in other words, if you tried programming in C, C++, or Assembly during school, or even just played around with them, Rust will make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if you have no experience with any of those languages? That&#39;s what the Rust community has been assuming, and has put as a target to tame. Over the many years of following Rust - the amount of Rust documentation, books, and guides that were created free and open by the community is staggering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I get that &amp;quot;Yes, but, how do I &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot; question a lot, I decided to create a community driven Github repo which answers it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jondot/rust-how-do-i-start&quot;&gt;rust-how-do-i-start&lt;/a&gt;. You can visit this repo and follow the track outlined there to get started in Rust in no time.And if you want some starting points for who may be hiring in Rust, you can check out the jobs section of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this-week-in-rust.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;This Week in Rust newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/search?q=flair_name%3A%22%F0%9F%92%BC%20jobs%22&amp;amp;restrict_sr=1&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;this Reddit search&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of luck on your Rust journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation is pleased to announce the awards of the 2022 Rust Foundation Fellowship Program, and the first tranche of the 2022 Project Grants Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many of you &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-09-news-rust-foundation-to-launch-community-grants-program/&quot;&gt;know&lt;/a&gt; by now, the Community Grants Program is a mechanism to provide funds to the Rust development community to support their work. There will be at least 21 Fellowships and 20 Project grants awarded. We are particularly pleased that grants will be awarded across the globe, with grant recipients spread across 15 countries, with approximately 35% beyond the United States and Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Fellowship award recognises long term contributors to the Rust Project, as well as newer ‘Associate Fellow’ entrants to the maintainer community looking to increase their contributions and skills in order to develop into the Rust leaders of the future. Rust Fellows are sponsored for one year to work on key priority Rust development. Alongside a monthly stipend to support the time they devote to Rust maintenance, Fellows will also receive a program of training, networking, and the opportunity to attend Rust-related events. Fellows and Project grant recipients will be working across the Rust ecosystem, with several focusing on language maintenance and improvement work, documentation, libraries, and learning materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Project Grant awards focus on specific pieces of work, which are time-limited, and clearly deliver a significant benefit to a reasonable proportion of the Rust community. Awards were made in three categories of project focus: Maintenance and Support, Development and Infrastructure, and Community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation received more than 60 applications for funding across the two grant streams. The successful awards represent investment in the maintenance and development of key areas of the Rust ecosystem, and we hope that this will mean tangible benefits for Rust users and maintainers alike, and an improved Rust landscape for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A full list of the Fellowship and Project awards by GitHub ID is available below. More details about the grantees and their work (including potential additional grantees and the values of the project grant awards) will be published on our website shortly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;thank-you-to-our-expert-advisors!&quot;&gt;Thank you to our Expert Advisors! &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-06-14-community-grants-program-awards-announcement/#thank-you-to-our-expert-advisors!&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are enormously grateful to a number of individuals that took on the role of ‘Expert Advisors’ to the Program in the course of assessing the applications submitted. The technical expertise that they provided means that we are very confident that the work being conducted through the awards will be relevant, high quality, impactful and will not place undue burden on existing maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A full list of the Expert Advisors is available below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-lessons-for-the-future&quot;&gt;Learning lessons for the future &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-06-14-community-grants-program-awards-announcement/#learning-lessons-for-the-future&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have learned a lot of lessons through this first iteration of the Community Grants Program, and as we have committed to doing all along, will likely tweak some of the processes for our next application window. We are proud of how this first application period has developed, but it was never going to be 100% perfect on the first try, and we want to make improvements for next time. We haven&#39;t landed on all of the specifics yet (we still have a lot of admin to do on the current awards first!), but we will definitely revisit some of the information, requirements and administration features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also struck by the number of applicants or potential applicants that expressed extreme reservations about their own skills, to the point of not applying because they didn&#39;t think it was worth it. We think it is worth noting that, on a number of these applications, our Expert Advisors provided glowing feedback, and those applicants were ultimately successful. We hope that we can provide more encouragement next time around to ensure that people with great skills know it is worth applying.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Cloud Compute Program Update</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-06-09-cloud-compute-program-update/"/>
		<updated>2022-06-09T16:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-06-09-cloud-compute-program-update/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In November 2021, The Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-11-16-news-announcing-cloud-compute-initiative/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the Cloud Compute Program, an initiative to provide free compute infrastructure for Rust Project maintainers around the world. Through the generous provision of cloud credits from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, the Foundation has worked with the Rust Project &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/infra&quot;&gt;Infrastructure team&lt;/a&gt; and other maintainers to configure the machine images necessary to support the access and usage of these systems for Rust development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, the cloud infrastructure has been undergoing initial testing. A small test group of Rust Project maintainers have been using the service to do real work in order to both understand its benefits and provide feedback for its improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud compute infrastructure has been used for three primary purposes. One was to verify those that &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have access &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; actually access the available machines, whether through a shell or, for example, VS Code and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview&quot;&gt;remote access extension&lt;/a&gt;. Another was to ensure all of the appropriate software is available to begin doing Rust development (e.g., git, all of the compiling prerequisites, etc.). And, finally, the infrastructure was used for the actual development and testing of the Rust language, particularly around the compiler and code generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feedback on the service has been positive. Since there was only one machine available for this test phase, the biggest issue was latency. However, that should be alleviated as more machines are spun up globally. There were also cases of users having local machines that were just as or more powerful than what is currently available by the cloud offering. That said, after some initial hiccups around access and having the necessary tooling, the actual development work provided noticeable efficiency wins for those that had less powerful development machines (e.g. i3 based laptops).  Build time improvements of 2-3x, to even on the order of 10x, were seen on various workloads. In addition, these efficiency gains allowed users to iterate on changes faster, running test suites on the cloud machines instead of relying on continuous integration (CI) systems in order to find and fix bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yaahc&quot;&gt;Jane Losare-Lusby&lt;/a&gt;, the first tester of the service, said, “&lt;em&gt;It&#39;s been fantastic to finally have access to a beefy machine for rustc builds that I don&#39;t have to spend time managing personally. It&#39;s 2-3 times faster than my laptop and helps me stay focused on fewer tasks for longer with shorter interruptions from test cycles.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ouz-a&quot;&gt;Oğuz Ağcayazı&lt;/a&gt;, another tester of the service, said, “&lt;em&gt;With cloud computing, I don&#39;t have to contemplate the meaning of life while waiting for compiler tests to finish, it finishes the task quicker and I can use my computer while tests are running.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are still some improvements we can make to the default machine images that are provided by this service (e.g., additional software and tooling, better user-data state persistence, targeted documentation on how to accomplish some tasks, etc.), we will soon open the Cloud Compute Program more broadly across the Rust Project. More machines will be brought online, across all three cloud compute platforms, around the world, so that other Rust maintainers can reap the benefits of this service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will let those on the various Rust Project governance teams know when they have access, and we look forward to observing how well this program scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for even more updates as we continue to expand the Cloud Compute Program offering.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Q1 2022 Update: A good start to the year!</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-05-03-a-good-start-to-the-year/"/>
		<updated>2022-05-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-05-03-a-good-start-to-the-year/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that we are firmly in Q2 of 2022, I wanted to update everyone on what the Foundation did internally during Q1, and how we are building a solid, sustainable organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation exists to steward the Rust language and support the Rust ecosystem. Externally, this should manifest in visible programs that provide various resources to individuals and/or to the entire Rust ecosystem. Internally, in practice, that involves a lot of legal, financial and administrative work to create, administer and organise those programs. International financial transactions for everything from membership dues to on-call contracts, salary payments to grant awards, need to be managed in a timely fashion. Even in-kind contributions require a fair bit of admin to manage. Legally, we need to ensure that we are complying with local and international laws that regulate our activities, that the Rust marks are secure and not open to abuse, that we have the right copyright and licensing policies in place, and that we are able to conduct the work we are constituted to do across multiple jurisdictions with vastly different legal structures. Generally, we have to have internal policies and procedures in place like any other organisation, to govern and manage things like human resources, security, records management and governance. We also need to manage our communications across channels, such as the website, social media and press, and administer our membership and our Board. These are just the things that we need to keep on top of to maintain a viable and legally compliant organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three months of 2022 represented a new beginning for the Foundation with regard to setting up processes for all of these things, identifying what we are legally responsible for, and starting to map our exposure to risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t provide an exhaustive list of every action we have taken, as we have done rather a lot, but below is an outline of the kinds of things we have been working on to ensure that the Rust Foundation is fit for purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staffing &amp;amp; Administration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcomed three new employees to the Foundation in Q1, so immediately had to ensure that we had the ability to run payroll in the UK and US, provide benefits, and write up policies and processes for things like leave, travel, security, grievance, health and safety, and personal development. We also set up internal structures for email/alias use, records management, developed an intranet, registered and migrated our email to &lt;a href=&quot;http://rustfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;rustfoundation.org&lt;/a&gt; (with a planned migration of the website to follow), analysed legacy documentation, and investigated and acquired subscriptions to perform necessary tasks (buffer, quickbooks, docusign etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finance &amp;amp; Legal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring our financial and legal obligations are met is a top priority. If we are in contravention of laws in any of the jurisdictions that we operate in, or if we are in debt or insolvent, then the whole organisation is in serious and immediate jeopardy. In Q1, we focused on ensuring we had the correct registrations, insurance and indemnity in the UK and US, suitable bank accounts, and legal agreements between our official entities to govern financial transactions. We also instigated the process of bringing our finance functions in-house, to reduce our expenditure and reliance on external consultants. Legally, we have mapped the legislation that we are subject to, consulted with legal counsel in the UK and US, and have pushed forward with trademarking Rust around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There remains a huge amount of work we need to do on legal, security and compliance issues. We will likely be reaching out to Project members to help us understand what our exposure to risk or legal obligation might be, and it is likely that we may need to implement some new policies or procedures to ensure infrastructure is secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to internal matters, we have been preparing the financial and legal basis for the Community Grants Program. Distributing funds around the world can get complicated, and we need formal agreements to ensure that we have an audit trail in place to meet our obligations as a non-profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Membership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our membership is growing steadily, and we now have 26 Silver and 6 Platinum members. Our bylaws state that once we had over 10 Silver members, a representative of the membership class could be elected onto the Board of Directors. We supported an election campaign and voting period between January-March, using ElectionBuddy to run the election itself, and we welcomed winner Andrew Wafaa of Arm to the Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been working with members on a Member Spotlight series for the Foundation blog, and we are in the process of working on some guest blogs from them. We are also reviewing our membership offer, and considering how we might be able to improve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Grants Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the top priorities for the Foundation has been getting the Community Grants Program up and running. We needed to build a mechanism for funding the community that was appropriate, effective, inclusive and impactful. We consulted with a lot of individuals in the funding and OSS space, and devised and ran a community survey to shape our funding structures. We drafted and redrafted proposals to ensure the Program was approved by the Board, and held several discussions with Project Directors to ensure the details were right. We had to investigate and choose a platform to manage the application process, write up all of the guidance, application questions and application materials, and devise a scoring matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foundation wants to be open and transparent with the community, and to communicate effectively. We have made some minor changes and additions to the website, which now has more useful information accessible to all. We have continued with our AMAs, and we have reduced our reliance on external consultants for the management of our social media. We are reaching out to the wider traditional media on a regular basis to ensure that Rust is promoted and that it remains relevant and admired in the wider tech world. We are proactively talking to journalists, and want to showcase positive stories in Rust, so do reach out if you have any stories that we could share!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realise this blog is completely focused on our internal activities this year, and that this may not be of interest to a lot of people, but I want to ensure that we are communicating how much we are actually doing. We are working very hard across a lot of different areas to build and sustain the Rust Foundation, so that it can effectively work for the benefit of the community. The team has achieved a lot in a very short space of time this year, and we look forward to growing and diversifying our programs of support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for another member spotlight! We hope you’ve been enjoying this series and the opportunity to learn more about our great silver members – we’ve enjoyed sharing their stories with you. In today’s edition, we hear from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tilladam/&quot;&gt;Till Adam&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Commercial Officer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kdab.com/&quot;&gt;KDAB&lt;/a&gt;. He shares details on the company’s work as well as its involvement with Rust. Read on for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;please-tell-us-a-little-about-kdab.-what-do-you-do-and-who-are-your-customers%3F&quot;&gt;Please tell us a little about KDAB. What do you do and who are your customers? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-04-19-member-spotlight-kdab/#please-tell-us-a-little-about-kdab.-what-do-you-do-and-who-are-your-customers%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDAB is a global software consultancy traditionally focused on cross-platform software development, mostly using C++, Qt and OpenGL. We are active primarily on the desktop and around embedded devices. On the desktop, we tend to have customers who deal with large amounts of complicated data from various sources like seismic sensors, high-end microscopes, medical imaging, industrial SCADA systems or game development environments. On the embedded side, we mostly focus on HMI and whole-platform aspects, often with an emphasis on performance, efficiency and correctness. We have also created and contributed to many open source projects around developer tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-us-about-kdab%E2%80%99s-use-of-rust.-how-are-you-using-it-currently-and-how-might-that-evolve%3F&quot;&gt;Tell us about KDAB’s use of Rust. How are you using it currently and how might that evolve? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-04-19-member-spotlight-kdab/#tell-us-about-kdab%E2%80%99s-use-of-rust.-how-are-you-using-it-currently-and-how-might-that-evolve%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see increasing curiosity about Rust, not only among our engineers but also with our customers. The promise of a better, safer C++ is attractive and is slowly starting to materialize in different applications and industries. We recently released the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/cxx-qt&quot;&gt;CXX-Qt crate&lt;/a&gt;, which allows smooth interoperability between user interfaces written in Qt/C++ and backend functionality that leverages Rust. Such hybrid systems are likely to come up in our customer projects more and more, as Rust gains more acceptance and relevance in the industries we are active in. Some of those industries – like medical, vehicles and industrial automation – stand to benefit significantly from what Rust brings because of regulatory and overall quality requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-was-kdab%E2%80%99s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;What was KDAB’s motivation to join the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-04-19-member-spotlight-kdab/#what-was-kdab%E2%80%99s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see Rust becoming a growing part of our business and would like to be part of the Foundation so we can keep in touch with all the latest developments and support the technology and community growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-going-forward%3F&quot;&gt;What do you hope the Rust Foundation will accomplish going forward? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-04-19-member-spotlight-kdab/#what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-going-forward%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope the Rust Foundation will continue to maintain the high standards it has set itself, keep provoking and promoting new and better code and software best practices and keep supporting and advancing the Rust ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-and-how-did-you-personally-get-involved-with-rust-itself-and-how-has-your-involvement-evolved%3F&quot;&gt;When and how did you personally get involved with Rust itself and how has your involvement evolved? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-04-19-member-spotlight-kdab/#when-and-how-did-you-personally-get-involved-with-rust-itself-and-how-has-your-involvement-evolved%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t get to write a lot of code on our projects anymore, so I’m relegated to personal pet projects and experimentation. That’s been fun so far, and I’m very impressed by the large and supportive community and the many existing projects to build on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you’ve been enjoying our member spotlight blog series and the chance to get to know our silver members a bit better. We think these posts provide a nice look at the myriad ways Rust is being utilized and the benefits it provides. Today’s installment comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/bminortx/&quot;&gt;Brandon Minor&lt;/a&gt;, Founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tangramvision.com/&quot;&gt;Tangram Vision&lt;/a&gt;. Read on to learn why he’s such a big fan of Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-us-about-tangram-vision.-what-do-you-do-and-who-do-you-serve%3F&quot;&gt;Tell us about Tangram Vision. What do you do and who do you serve? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-04-11-member-spotlight-tangram-vision/#tell-us-about-tangram-vision.-what-do-you-do-and-who-do-you-serve%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tangram Vision is a Perception DevOps company for robotics, AV, drones, and perception-enabled systems. The idea behind Tangram Vision came from our frustration of needing to build the same perception stack &lt;em&gt;yet again&lt;/em&gt; at every company we worked with. So, we decided to build the perception stack we always wished we had, in order to save everyone else the trouble!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tangram Vision Platform takes care of complex perception tasks like sensor fusion, calibration, and diagnostics so companies can deploy autonomy with confidence, all built on a scalable data backend that allows them to track, optimize, and analyze every sensor in their fleet. If this sounds like you, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.tangramvision.com/&quot;&gt;sign up for early access here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-is-tangram-vision-using-rust%3F&quot;&gt;How is Tangram Vision using Rust? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-04-11-member-spotlight-tangram-vision/#how-is-tangram-vision-using-rust%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re a Rust shop, through and through. We started with Rust from the very beginning, and – like a growing number of our peers in the world of robotics and autonomy – we believe it&#39;s now the best language to bring the stability and speed that these sophisticated systems need. If we need a tool that doesn&#39;t exist yet in the ecosystem, we write it ourselves. You can find many of these tools in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/tangram-vision/oss&quot;&gt;Open-Source Repositories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-rust-helping-tangram-vision-solve-any-particular-challenges%3F-anything-other-languages-couldn%E2%80%99t-address%3F&quot;&gt;Is Rust helping Tangram Vision solve any particular challenges? Anything other languages couldn’t address? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-04-11-member-spotlight-tangram-vision/#is-rust-helping-tangram-vision-solve-any-particular-challenges%3F-anything-other-languages-couldn%E2%80%99t-address%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust pulls double-duty in our software stack by making the code we write safer, while also making the code we &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; safer, like hardware and firmware interfaces from other vendors. Many sensor manufacturers expect end users of their products to figure out integration, but this leads to all sorts of technical landmines. At Tangram Vision, we have found that we can mitigate a lot of the worst effects of bad sensor code just by approaching the problem with Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-tangram-vision-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;Why did Tangram Vision join the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-04-11-member-spotlight-tangram-vision/#why-did-tangram-vision-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust is the best language we’ve collectively worked with for full-stack robotics and perception development, full-stop. We want to be both evangelists and stewards of the language as it matures for our markets; joining the Rust Foundation was just another step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-your-hopes-for-the-future-of-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;What are your hopes for the future of the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-04-11-member-spotlight-tangram-vision/#what-are-your-hopes-for-the-future-of-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given our company mission, we have a vested interest in both the technological and commercial development of the language. We want to work with the Rust Foundation to set goals on both fronts, making it easier for other enterprises to contribute to the ecosystem as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-us-about-your-personal-journey%2Finvolvement-with-rust.&quot;&gt;Tell us about your personal journey/involvement with Rust. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-04-11-member-spotlight-tangram-vision/#tell-us-about-your-personal-journey%2Finvolvement-with-rust.&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/why-were-choosing-rust&quot;&gt;I wrote a whole blog post about it on the Tangram Vision blog&lt;/a&gt;! This paragraph sums it up concisely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust makes bad code hard to write. I mean, it makes it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to write. When I was first trying out the language, I found it infinitely frustrating; the way I habitually wrote code for years was being torn apart by compiler messages and warnings. My ego had a hard time taking the hit. Once I started to pick apart the methodology, though, I understood just how powerful this language could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-your-favorite-feature%2Fthing-about-rust%3F&quot;&gt;What is your favorite feature/thing about Rust? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-04-11-member-spotlight-tangram-vision/#what-is-your-favorite-feature%2Fthing-about-rust%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world would be a darker place without &lt;u&gt;Clippy&lt;/u&gt;. That, and the fact that I don’t lose a day of engineering to dependency wrangling anymore thanks to &lt;u&gt;crates.io&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Rust Foundation Community Grants Program 2022 Opens for Applications</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-31-cgp-is-open-announcement/"/>
		<updated>2022-03-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-31-cgp-is-open-announcement/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation is delighted to announce that its Community Grants Program 2022 is now open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many of you know by now, the Community Grants Program is a mechanism to provide funds to the Rust development community to support their work. We have consulted widely in building the Program, and want to thank everyone who took the time to give us their ideas and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that Rust is growing incredibly fast. Its popularity is increasing, the user base is growing, and innovation is happening globally. This is testament to what a great language Rust is, and we want to maintain that momentum to ensure that Rust is sustainable and fit for purpose in the long term. Our consultation identified some key challenges - the well known ‘steep learning curve’ in learning Rust, the fact that maintainers and Teams are generally overstretched, and the gaps in resources available to address existing issues. We have designed the Community Grants Program to tackle some of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is surprisingly complex figuring out how to distribute financial awards to a large, diverse and highly technical community. We had to understand the priorities, motivations and challenges that community members have. We had to ensure the Program, as a global initiative, was meaningfully supporting diversity and inclusion. We had to consider how funding certain activities might impact upon the work of others. And we had to balance the need to make the process ‘light-touch’ with the need to be accountable for our spending and to enable us to demonstrate impact to our funders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation Community Grants Program 2022 has a budget of $625,000 thanks to our generous donors AWS, Huawei and Google. It is comprised of four funding streams to support diverse needs across the Rust community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rust Foundation Fellowships&lt;/strong&gt;:  A one-year award available for up to 20 individuals providing a stipend of $1,000 USD per month, plus a travel and training budget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Grants&lt;/strong&gt;: Single awards made to individuals, groups, or organizations for discrete pieces of work in the range of $1,000 to $20,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event Support Grants&lt;/strong&gt;: Single awards ranging from $100 to $500 to support events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardship Award Grants&lt;/strong&gt;: Single awards ranging from $500 to $1,500 made to community members facing financial hardship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from the consultation that community members are particularly interested in individual forms of sponsorship over a sustained period. We therefore designed the Rust Foundation Fellowship to provide a package of support to individual maintainers in the Rust Project that goes beyond a financial stipend. This will provide Fellows with a range of opportunities to learn complementary skills, attend events, and network with different stakeholders in the Rust ecosystem, while working on the Rust activities that most interest them. The Fellowship will also bring new faces and diversity to the maintainer community. These new community members will benefit from mentorship from the Project Teams, and be poised to become the Rust leaders of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We heard many times during our consultation that bug fixes, documentation, learning materials and new features were priorities for a wide range of people invested in Rust. Our Project Grants are designed to enable a wide range of activities to address these kinds of issues, as well as to invest in innovative new projects that will benefit the wider community. We have set a cap on Project Grants at $20,000 to ensure that we can fund a wide range of activities all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time an initiative such as this has been developed for the Rust community. We believe that this mechanism will deliver positive outcomes, targeting funding where it will be impactful for the wider Rust community and ensuring we can evidence the benefits to make the case for future funding. We have structured the application and award process to be fair, inclusive and accountable, and we will be publishing full details of our decisions (except in the case of hardship awards). We are committed to learning from our experience of running this Program and will iterate to ensure we are providing the best possible package of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the information on eligibility, how to apply, and FAQs can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us at the Foundation are genuinely excited about the great people and projects that will be supported through the Community Grants Program.  We look forward to receiving your applications!&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2022-03-29T16:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-29-member-spotlight-wyliodrin/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-03-29-member-spotlight-wyliodrin/member-spotlight-alexandru-radovici.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alexandru Radovici&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our latest Member Spotlight blog. We’re pleased to report that our silver member roster continues to grow, and we’re excited to introduce you to all our great member companies and the work they do across a variety of sectors. Today we heard from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandruradovici/&quot;&gt;Alexandru Radovici&lt;/a&gt;, Founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wyliodrin.com/&quot;&gt;Wyliodrin&lt;/a&gt;. Read on to learn more about the company and how it’s putting Rust to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-us-about-wyliodrin.-what-do-you-do-and-who-do-you-serve%3F&quot;&gt;Tell us about Wyliodrin. What do you do and who do you serve? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-29-member-spotlight-wyliodrin/#tell-us-about-wyliodrin.-what-do-you-do-and-who-do-you-serve%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started Wyliodrin in 2014 with the goal of making IoT development available to everyone. When we launched, the company was primarily focused on education providers, but we have since shifted largely toward the industrial space. Today we build custom software for clients in industrial and automotive systems. Our product is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://wyliodrin.com/iot-industry&quot;&gt;IoTWay&lt;/a&gt; and is a cloud platform for IoT development that enables remote deployment and updates of software on edge devices on a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-is-wyliodrin-using-rust%3F&quot;&gt;How is Wyliodrin using Rust? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-29-member-spotlight-wyliodrin/#how-is-wyliodrin-using-rust%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started using Rust as a contributor to an open source project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tockos.org/&quot;&gt;TockOS&lt;/a&gt; and found it to be a great fit for our needs. We were looking for an alternative to Node.js, which was very resource intensive, and Rust fit the bill. Today we have a number of active client deployments in which industrial equipment is using Rust as a software. Around 30% of our client base currently uses the language, and we hope to see adoption grow, especially now that we have the Foundation and its member companies lending it some additional exposure and credibility. Those who are using Rust have been pleased with the results and development time – we delivered results faster than the .net team could deliver the UI! There also haven’t been any support issues reported, which is a very positive sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-you-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;Why did you join the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-29-member-spotlight-wyliodrin/#why-did-you-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust has helped us significantly in recent years. We’ve had some really good business with it, and we thought we could help in this effort to promote the language’s usage and growth. We’re a small company, but we wanted to be a part of the change. I grew up with computers and started programing in 1991, and in my view Rust was a real breakthrough. In my opinion, the C language needs to be replaced, and Rust excites me because it is an effective alternative – something I’ve been waiting many years for! I’m really happy that the Foundation is now in place and the Rust Project can go on. We believe in Rust, and being there as silver members is our small contribution to that effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-your-hopes-for-the-future-of-the-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;What are your hopes for the future of the Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-29-member-spotlight-wyliodrin/#what-are-your-hopes-for-the-future-of-the-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think things are going nicely with the development of the Rust language. One of the biggest challenges that I see is accessibility for those new to writing in Rust. Resources exist, but the learning curve is steep and it remains challenging for beginners. I am also a lecturer at a university, and I’m trying to leverage Rust in my teaching. I’ve gotten lots of comments from students on the lack of documentation and that things aren’t clear. I would love to see more accessible documentation and introductory materials to help ensure new users aren’t deterred and that the ecosystem can continue to grow. I’m hopeful that the Foundation can help make some resources like that more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Rust Community Grants Program - Survey Responses</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/"/>
		<updated>2022-03-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who responded to our survey about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/&quot;&gt;Community Grants Program&lt;/a&gt;. We are very grateful that you took the time to provide us with your thoughts and ideas. We are now busy working on the final details of the Program in order to open for applications next month, and we wanted to share the results of the survey with you to demonstrate how your input has influenced our thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/#background&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2022 the Rust Foundation opened a survey with the objective of gathering the views of the Rust maintainer community about the issues that concerned them and the areas that they felt were most in need of financial support. The aim of this exercise is to help inform the Community Grants Program and to ensure that, as far as is possible within our operational constraints, the funding streams that we launch will go some way to meeting the needs of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-responded&quot;&gt;Who responded &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/#who-responded&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total 122 completed responses to the survey were received, breaking down by language as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;English: &lt;strong&gt;102&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chinese (including simplified): &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russian: &lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;German: &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;French: &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portuguese: &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high proportion of responses to the English language version of the survey somewhat belies the geographic diversity of those who responded. Of those 102 only 44 came from the USA/UK, the remainder were spread across 27 different countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the level of engagement with the Rust Project, a third of respondents described themselves as active contributors. It is interesting to note, however, that breaking out the results into those who completed the English version of the survey, and those who completed the non-English version reveals significant differences, with fewer than one in seven in the latter group considering themselves to be active contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend was continued with memberships of Rust teams, with markedly higher levels of engagement from those who responded in English compared to those who did not. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that English is the default technical language of these teams. What is significant is that almost two thirds of the non-English respondents expressed a desire to be a member of a team, project group, or working group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/cgp-respondents.png&quot; alt=&quot;Breakdown of respondents by self-description&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-people-want-us-to-fund%3F&quot;&gt;What do people want us to fund? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/#what-do-people-want-us-to-fund%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each respondent was asked to select five options from a list of potential funding priorities, with the additional option to add in free-text responses to encompass anything missed out. Again we thought that it would be useful to show both the total results and the English/non-English splits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/cgp-funding-priorities.png&quot; alt=&quot;What funding priorities the respondents selected&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation was top across the board. The English responses largely mirrored the overall totals, due to their share of the sample size, and the non-English responses broadly aligned as well. It was interesting to see, however, that Educational Materials indexed significantly higher for the non-English group, and Performance Enhancements were also somewhat higher, with New Features being less significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what%2Fhow-should-things-be-funded%3F&quot;&gt;What/How should things be funded? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/#what%2Fhow-should-things-be-funded%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked to rate on a scale of 1-9 a number of different funding options, with the scores summed to enable ranking. Again, this is shown as both a total and split by response languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/cgp-funding-methods.png&quot; alt=&quot;How respondents said things should be funded&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular options clustered fairly tightly together in terms of scoring, with the funding of projects and individuals (in the latter case either through direct sponsorship or a Fellowship) scoring highly. There was fairly close alignment again in the language splits, though for the non-English respondents there was higher indexing both for the support of infrastructure and the funding of organisations, than was the case for those who completed the survey in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;potential-points-of-focus&quot;&gt;Potential points of focus &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/#potential-points-of-focus&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of common themes arose in the text responses, and these are outlined below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rust-is-difficult-to-learn&quot;&gt;Rust is difficult to learn &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/#rust-is-difficult-to-learn&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust’s steep learning curve has significant consequences for the growth of the community. It limits the number of people learning, and then using, the language, and this then means that the potential population of people who may become contributors, reviewers, and so on is similarly limited. It can also limit the adoption and usage of the language by organizations who may be minded to provide financial, or in-kind, support to the project in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the survey results the highest scoring response to the question relating to funding priorities was “Documentation” with 50% of respondents listing that as a priority. Similarly, 28% of respondents listed “producing educational materials” as a priority (and as noted above, this indexed much more significantly among the non-English respondents). Specific write-in priorities include more activities like Rustbridge, a new website, and generally better books/documentation. Comments included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving the tooling ecosystem (test runner, &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;crates.io&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://lib.rs/&quot;&gt;lib.rs&lt;/a&gt; offers some features missing from &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;crates.io&lt;/a&gt; IMO), cargo, official support/guidance for common build environments like Docker (see cargo-chef) Complete WIP &amp;quot;rust books&amp;quot; and update older ones. Continuing improving the tooling and accessibility of the rust core to solicit new active contributors. Try to improve the language by simplifying or consolidating language features&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing intermediate/advanced educational content for Rust developers. Building commonly-needed low-level data structures and concurrency primitives for the Rust ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More rust books for different examples/better more explicit examples&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-project-teams-are-overstretched&quot;&gt;The Project Teams are overstretched &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/#the-project-teams-are-overstretched&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the volunteer-led (and run) project teams are all, to some degree, overstretched. This results in delays in reviewing and merging, pull requests (i.e. code review - cited by 40% of respondents as a key priority); limits their ability to mentor and develop people who could become valuable contributors to the project, carry out development work themselves, and so on. It also places undue stress upon team members, bringing with it the risk of burnout. Comments from the survey include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping contributors that I mentor able to keep contributing so the teaching work I put into said mentoring keeps benefiting the project. Funding the unpaid team members so they have more time to review the ever growing list of open pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want the foundation to focus on supporting the overall health of the Rust project. Making sure we have enough maintainers to review PRs and mentor other contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing and triaging pull requests. Helping understaffed teams grow carefully. Helping teams get a handle on their large volume of incoming PRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;help maintain important projects whose maintainers are missing or overwhelmed...am thinking stuff like chrono, dotenv, and mdbook&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;coordination%2Forganisation-could-be-improved&quot;&gt;Coordination/organisation could be improved &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/#coordination%2Forganisation-could-be-improved&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of people responding to the survey raised the issue of the lack of overall coordination of the project, and/or the lack of resources that are dedicated to the overall management of the project. This is due in no small part to the volunteer-led nature of the project teams that are, as previously mentioned, already overstretched. Comments from the survey include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&#39;t have a functional website team, vision for how our online assets should tie together, or designers on staff. This work is crucial, but entirely unfunded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have lots of people doing work, and not nearly enough people helping to do organizational and process work. Building and maintaining tools that help implement that process. Better overall product management (building consensus about relative priorities across the Rust project/product)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing better processes for tracking and managing large numbers of issues. Picking up the follow-through after people develop new features, such as stabilizing nightly features and making sure they fit with other features. Reviewing and triaging pull requests. Helping understaffed teams grow carefully. Helping teams get a handle on their large volume of incoming PRs. Designing lower-friction processes for teams to collaborate when development projects cross the jurisdiction between teams. Finding and mentoring development of critical features that will unlock many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-resource-required-to-address-bugs%2C-compiler-speed%2C-technical-debt-etc.&quot;&gt;More resource required to address bugs, compiler speed, technical debt etc. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/#more-resource-required-to-address-bugs%2C-compiler-speed%2C-technical-debt-etc.&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the respondents to the survey highlighted technical debt, unfixed bugs, and also the speed of the compiler. Specifically, 41% of respondents cited bug fixes as a key priority, and 41% noted performance issues. Comments from the survey include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QA in general. Someone who leads a team of hired hands to provide sustained downward pressure on total bug count, integration cycle time, compiler slowness. Measurable goals, universally valued, with long term investment in staffing for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of bug fixes, performance fixes and feature implementations require massive refactorings before they become feasible. Several contributors have given up on such projects because of the amount of technical debt we have accrued. We should have a focussed and paid group to deal with such major refactorings that unblock a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compiler Speed. I work for a company that is interested in Rust and potentially sponsor Rust with a lot of money. But they currently don&#39;t like the compiler speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s important to me that getting funding for internal cleanups and organizational stuff is straightforward . . .Other areas I care about even if they aren&#39;t my main focus are diagnostics, performance improvements and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compiler speed so it can be used in web projects and perform quicker deployments when -cargo build -release is called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-insights-that-will-help-shape-our-approach-to-the-grants-program&quot;&gt;Further insights that will help shape our approach to the Grants Program &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/#further-insights-that-will-help-shape-our-approach-to-the-grants-program&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were lots of responses that have been useful in helping us develop our approach to the grants program. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communicate, communicate, communicate. Make the application process simple, feature updates from the recipients, publish guidance on how to apply and how to improve one&#39;s chances of a successful application, report on the website from the Foundation on what worked, what didn&#39;t work and any changes to the program. Be excessively transparent so that the impression that having relationships with members of the Foundation or of Rust leadership aren&#39;t determinant on receiving grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very keen to respect this view in terms of how we approach both the processes and the reporting of the grants program. Making the scoring system open and transparent will be key to this. We also recognise that there are a number of different views on how we achieve the goals of the Program and recognise work in the Project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should fund people who have done great work for Rust and who we expect to continue to do great work for Rust. We shouldn&#39;t pay on the expectation of specific future work, but rather, on the expectation that their work overall will be valuable to the Rust community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I receive some support, I would like some stability in it. I&#39;m a student, with this I&#39;m able to review and contribute most of the year. However, there are two or three months when my studies take priority and I have to reduce my time-commitment. If the payout would always be a result of the activity last month, it could lead contributors to contemplate if they can take a break from the project. As a solution, I think the support should be based on a larger time frame, like two or three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…don&#39;t hire anonymously or through a ghost-work / piece-work system. Hire from the community and ensure it&#39;s people who do actually care about helping the project for its own sake. There&#39;s a threshold of routine-work-for-low-pay below which the overhead of interpreting and absorbing the work outweighs its value to the recipient. An army of anonymous bug-closers with no meaningful connection to the project would be disruptive to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These, and many other responses have been hugely useful as we develop our approach to funding people who work on Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-factors-in-how-we-shape-the-community-grants-program&quot;&gt;Other factors in how we shape the Community Grants Program &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/#other-factors-in-how-we-shape-the-community-grants-program&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the survey have been incredibly useful in shaping our thinking, and we will be adding this input to considerations from other sources. We have taken advice from other individuals and organisations that have experience with funding in this space. Importantly, we have had some excellent input from our key donors to the Program to understand their interests and ambitions for the Program and what we need to do to ensure it is considered a success. We very much want to ensure that we are able to provide funding to the community year on year, and this means that we need to demonstrate the value and impact to our corporate donors, and deliver strong arguments to provide funding in future years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happens-next%3F&quot;&gt;What happens next? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-17-community-grants-program-survey-responses/#what-happens-next%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple of weeks, we will be finalising our plans, so that we will be ready to launch at the start of April.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Announcing three new Rust Foundation Board Members</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-16-news-announcing-three-new-board-members-copy/"/>
		<updated>2022-03-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-16-news-announcing-three-new-board-members-copy/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is delighted to announce that three new individuals have joined the Board of Directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ryan-levick-(project-director---core-team)&quot;&gt;Ryan Levick (Project Director - Core Team) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-16-news-announcing-three-new-board-members-copy/#ryan-levick-(project-director---core-team)&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/headshot/ryan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ryan Levick&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Levick has been a proud Rustacean since 2015 and has been involved in the Rust project since 2019. His involvement in the project has been very varied, with his current focus being on Core Team responsibilities. While Ryan enjoys ‘bit twiddling’ as much as any system programmer, he finds himself most comfortable at the intersection of software and people. Ryan works at Microsoft as a developer advocate focusing on Rust. He lives with his partner in Berlin, though he&#39;s originally from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan replaces Florian Gilcher as a Core Team representative on the Rust Foundation Board of Directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;andrew-wafaa-(member-director---silver-membership-representative)&quot;&gt;Andrew Wafaa (Member Director - Silver Membership Representative) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-16-news-announcing-three-new-board-members-copy/#andrew-wafaa-(member-director---silver-membership-representative)&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/headshot/andrew.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Andrew Wafaa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Wafaa is a Distinguished Engineer and Senior Director of Software Communities at Arm, the leading Semiconductor IP design company. He leads Arm’s Open Source Office, where he is responsible for Arm’s adoption, use and participation in open source; as well as building and maintaining relationships with various open source projects and communities. He has been heavily engaged in open source projects for over 20 years and has served on – and continues to serve on – various community and industry bodies, including the FreeBSD Foundation Board, the Xen Project Board and the Yocto Project, where he currently serves as Chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew was elected by our Silver Members and is our first Silver Membership Representative on the Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;eric-garcia-(member-director---meta)&quot;&gt;Eric Garcia (Member Director - Meta) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-16-news-announcing-three-new-board-members-copy/#eric-garcia-(member-director---meta)&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/headshot/eric.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Eric Garcia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric is a Software Engineering Manager at Meta, a Rust Foundation Platinum Member, supporting Rust developers across Meta’s portfolio of products. Before working on Rust, Eric has spent over a decade in the industry working on programming languages, compilers, and runtimes for x86.  Most notably are his contributions in automatic vectorization for C, C++, Fortran, DPC++, and OpenCL. His passions are improving developer experiences with state-of-the-art, and high performant tool chains.  Outside of Rust, you can find Eric flying above the San Francisco Bay Area as a student pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric replaces Joel Marcey (&lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-22-news-rust-foundation-attracts-top-talent-to-senior-leadership-roles/&quot;&gt;who has taken a full time role at the Foundation&lt;/a&gt;) as Member Director for Meta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for another installment of our member spotlight blog series, designed to introduce you to our diverse community of silver member companies. Having recently passed our one-year anniversary, we at the Rust Foundation are thrilled at the growth we’ve seen to date in our silver member roster. We’re honored and privileged to have the support of such an interesting and dynamic group, and we look forward to all the great work we can achieve together. Today, we hear from Nathan West, Senior Developer, Client Apps (and Senior Rustacean) at &lt;a href=&quot;https://1password.com/&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;. Read on to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

What do you do and who do you serve? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-08-member-spotlight-1password/#tell-us-a-bit-about-1password.-what-do-you-do-and-who-do-you-serve%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Password has been protecting individuals, families, and businesses for the last 15 years. Our password manager keeps their secrets safe, accessible, and easy to use no matter what devices or operating systems they rely on. Besides passwords, we protect payment information, private notes, medical records, business secrets, and over 20 other kinds of data. We’re always working to bridge the gap between security and convenience so anyone can protect their data and take charge of their online safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-is-1password-using-rust%3F&quot;&gt;How is 1Password using Rust? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-08-member-spotlight-1password/#how-is-1password-using-rust%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, our Windows team started experimenting with Rust and loved it – bugs and crash reports decreased. Eventually, the rest of our team saw the value of Rust, and things took off from there. We’d gone from being unfamiliar with Rust to a prototype of filling within the browser, and it was a turning point for 1Password development. Now, around 63 percent of the 1Password core is using Rust. It powers the latest versions of our client apps and browser extensions. It provides the fundamental logic that underpins everything from encryption to sync, ensuring a consistent, performant experience no matter what combination of operating system and device you’re using. The newest versions of our client applications and browser extensions share a common Rust backend that ensures we provide a consistent look, feel, and experience across any browser and operating system combination. Crucially, 1Password has to be secure, but it also has to be fast. Rust enables the secure management of passwords and other secrets, and allows us to evict them from memory as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-benefits-have-you-seen-from-using-rust%3F-what-has-it-helped-your-company-achieve%3F&quot;&gt;What benefits have you seen from using Rust? What has it helped your company achieve? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-08-member-spotlight-1password/#what-benefits-have-you-seen-from-using-rust%3F-what-has-it-helped-your-company-achieve%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1Password deploys Rust across a wide range of computing contexts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating systems&lt;/strong&gt;: Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devices&lt;/strong&gt;: phones, tablets, watches, desktop PCs, servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computing architectures&lt;/strong&gt;: ARM, x86-64, and WebAssembly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us a unique perspective on the language’s flexibility and productivity benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​​For example, as 1Password was growing, there was a divergence between the different platforms – 1Password 7 for Windows felt different than 1Password for Mac, and so on. Now, Rust empowers our whole team to write code across the entire product stack. We can ship Rust to every platform we want, which means not only do we realize all the technical benefits of Rust, but we can also deliver a much more consistent cross-platform experience than we have in the past. Rust makes this possible and accessible in a way that few languages do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust puts both a technical and cultural emphasis on the correctness of all things, enabling us to work more confidently in a distributed setting. An extremely strict compiler means that if changes to one platform might affect another adversely, we find out about it quickly, providing us with cross-platform confidence that helps us scale our teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-was-1password%E2%80%99s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;What was 1Password’s motivation to join the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-08-member-spotlight-1password/#what-was-1password%E2%80%99s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a community-driven project, Rust derives much of its success from the wealth of viewpoints that have informed its development since the beginning. We think this community is critical to the language’s continued success. Joining the Rust Foundation allows us to add our voice to that community and help the project become even more secure, productive, and accessible to developers of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-in-the-months-and-years-ahead%3F&quot;&gt;What do you hope the Rust Foundation will accomplish in the months and years ahead? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-08-member-spotlight-1password/#what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-in-the-months-and-years-ahead%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a technical level, I’d love to see the Foundation continue to support the work of the language team and third party open source contributors in improving the language’s capabilities, as well as continuing to improve the developer experience in areas like WebAssembly, cryptography, and supply chain integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a bigger-picture level though, my hope is that the Rust Foundation continues to nurture the inclusive, independent, community-led spirit of the project. Rust isn’t owned by any one organization or leader, and I believe it’s that diversity of input and distributed leadership that’s helped Rust thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-and-how-did-you-personally-get-involved-with-rust-itself-and-how-has-your-involvement-evolved%3F&quot;&gt;When and how did you personally get involved with Rust itself and how has your involvement evolved? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-03-08-member-spotlight-1password/#when-and-how-did-you-personally-get-involved-with-rust-itself-and-how-has-your-involvement-evolved%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first became interested in Rust in 2015 when I heard it was similar to C++, my favorite language at the time. I’d always been a fan of C++ because of the way it provides precise and deterministic control over your resources and how your program could run and behave. Rust shares these ideas, so I was excited to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2017, Rust had essentially totally replaced C++ and Python as my favorite language for personal projects. In 2018, I started making standard library contributions and I was gaining confidence in my understanding of how Rust works. I became very active in the Rust community, particularly on Twitter, where I started to discover the many people learning and sharing their experiences with Rust in real time. I would reply to those tweets with encouragement and try to offer help and advice where I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing this into the present, I got hired at 1Password largely on the strength of my Rust knowledge, and on my enthusiasm in teaching and advocating for the language. The company needed people who were not just able to write good Rust code, but who could come in and provide strong feedback, teach proper patterns, and cultivate best practice techniques to help the engineering team transition to a Rust-based foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Rust’s steep learning curve can be unforgiving, it’s exactly that precision and fastidiousness that make it such a good fit for 1Password. Its strictness naturally enforces a meticulous approach to coding that helps us avoid critical errors and vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a security company, we couldn’t ask for a more fitting community to align ourselves with as we build the next generation of 1Password.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-02-22-news-rust-foundation-attracts-top-talent-to-senior-leadership-roles/feb_2022_foundation_new_hires.png&quot; alt=&quot;Feb 2022 Foundation New Hires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February 22, 2022 Wakefield, Mass – The &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust Foundation&lt;/a&gt; today announced three new additions to its team, with two new senior appointments leading the organization’s financial and operational strategic delivery. In a coup for the Foundation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoelMarcey&quot;&gt;Joel Marcey&lt;/a&gt; joins as Director of Operations and Advocacy, with a wide technical and operational portfolio to develop, support and safeguard the Rust ecosystem. Marcey is a Facebook/Meta alum with 25 years of engineering, advocacy and open source experience. Previously serving as a Member Director for Meta on the Rust Foundation Board of Directors, Marcey now moves to take a more hands-on role in shaping the future of the Foundation. His appointment signals the commitment the Foundation has to meaningfully developing robust systems to support the Rust Project, while retaining the consensus-based approach that Rust is famed for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussing the role, Marcey said &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Having been on the Board for nearly a year, I have developed my appreciation for not only the potential of the language itself, but also the dedication of those that develop and maintain it. I now get an opportunity to support this community in a direct and meaningful way from inside the Foundation. I am very excited to be part of this journey.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also joining the leadership team as Director of Finance and Funding is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-lenz-64b4002/&quot;&gt;Paul Lenz&lt;/a&gt;. With a background in senior roles spanning telecoms, open source and non-profit, Lenz joins the Foundation from the UK based Indigo Trust, a philanthropic body supporting digital, legal, and development projects in the UK, Europe and Africa. Lenz will be responsible for the financial management of the Foundation, as well as the development and management of the Rust Foundation Community Grants Program, which aims to award over $700k per year in funds to grow, sustain, and innovate within the Rust ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding of open source development and maintenance has unique challenges, and Lenz said of the role, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I am hugely excited to be joining the Foundation and to play a leading role in supporting the Rust community. There is huge potential within this community to drive innovation, and I look forward to supporting this through the Community Grants Program.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completing the trio of new hires is Abi Broom, who joins as Operations Manager and is responsible for transforming the internal capacity of the Foundation to meet its growing ambition. Broom has 20 years of experience implementing and formalizing systems and procedures in growing organizations across the digital and non-profit spaces. She has a keen interest in digital transformation and the possibilities offered by new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Director &amp;amp; CEO Rebecca Rumbul said of the appointments, &amp;quot;*Joel, with his detailed knowledge of the Rust ecosystem and deep understanding of both the big tech and open source world, is a fantastic addition to the Rust Foundation leadership team. The fact that we were able to lure him away from Meta shows just how exciting a time this is for the Foundation, and how much confidence exists in our vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul not only has CFO and CEO experience, but is a thought leader in effective grant-making and will ensure that our community awards are fit for purpose. I am delighted that we also have Abi coming on board to manage the day-to-day operations. She has successfully run a number of non-profit start-ups in the past and has supported their growth. I know she will be an asset to the Foundation. All three appointments put us in a great position to amplify our impact and to deliver programs of work that will have meaningful benefits for users and maintainers of Rust, our corporate members, and the wider ecosystem.*&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Member Spotlight: Mainmatter</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-16-member-spotlight-mainmatter/"/>

&lt;p&gt;Note: In September 2022, simplabs was rebranded to Mainmatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-02-16-member-spotlight-simplabs/member_spotlight_marco_otte-witte.png&quot; alt=&quot;Marco Otte-Witte&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another installment of our Member Spotlight series, the blog series in which we introduce our family of Rust Foundation Silver Members to the greater community. We’re thrilled to have such an interesting and diverse set of companies on board and even more excited to see our community continue to grow. Today we hear from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marcoow&quot;&gt;Marco Otte-Witte&lt;/a&gt;, Founder and Managing Director of Mainmatter (formerly simplabs). Read on to learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://mainmatter.com/&quot;&gt;Mainmatter&lt;/a&gt;, how the company uses Rust and future plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-us-about-mainmatter.-what-do-you-do-and-who-do-you-serve%3F&quot;&gt;Tell us about Mainmatter. What do you do and who do you serve? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-16-member-spotlight-mainmatter/#tell-us-about-mainmatter.-what-do-you-do-and-who-do-you-serve%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainmatter builds high quality web applications with international clients. We provide design and engineering services as well as mentoring for product development teams. Our focus to date has mostly been on the Ember.js frontend framework, but we are now diversifying to offer teams support with other technologies as well, and Rust is particularly exciting to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-is-mainmatter-using-rust%3F&quot;&gt;How is Mainmatter using Rust? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-16-member-spotlight-mainmatter/#how-is-mainmatter-using-rust%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a company that is primarily focused on web applications, the two main areas where Rust is of interest to us are Web Assembly and using it to implement backend servers. Some of our engineers are active on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/&quot;&gt;crates.io&lt;/a&gt; team, which is written with Ember.js on the frontend and Rust on the backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-rust-helping-mainmatter-solve-any-particular-challenges%3F-anything-other-languages-couldn%E2%80%99t-address%3F&quot;&gt;Is Rust helping Mainmatter solve any particular challenges? Anything other languages couldn’t address? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-16-member-spotlight-mainmatter/#is-rust-helping-mainmatter-solve-any-particular-challenges%3F-anything-other-languages-couldn%E2%80%99t-address%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love the combination of speed and safety. Some compiled languages are similarly fast, but it is easy to cause crashes and memory issues. On the other hand, some languages focus on safety, but they can often be an order of magnitude slower on runtime. Rust gives us the benefits of both worlds and lets our engineers work on projects with much higher confidence than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-mainmatter-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;Why did Mainmatter join the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-16-member-spotlight-mainmatter/#why-did-mainmatter-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite simply, because our engineers love Rust and would like to get involved more. We are generally pretty involved with the open source community and like to support the ecosystems around the technologies we specialize in. We&#39;re also an official sponsor of the Ember.js project as well as a founding sponsor of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-your-hopes-for-the-future-of-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;What are your hopes for the future of the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-16-member-spotlight-mainmatter/#what-are-your-hopes-for-the-future-of-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main focus of the Rust Foundation is supporting the teams that work on the Rust language as well as the wider ecosystem. We believe that it is beneficial to not have a single company be the owner of a language, and we are confident that the Rust Foundation can continue to bring together support from many different companies to help its maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-us-about-your-personal-journey%2Finvolvement-with-rust.&quot;&gt;Tell us about your personal journey/involvement with Rust. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-16-member-spotlight-mainmatter/#tell-us-about-your-personal-journey%2Finvolvement-with-rust.&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of our engineers have been involved with the Rust project for many years. We got drawn into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/&quot;&gt;crates.io&lt;/a&gt; team due to their usage of Ember.js for the frontend and are now also regularly contributing to the Rust backend code. We recently started to run internal Rust workshops within our company and are planning to open them up to the public soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-your-favorite-thing%2Ffeature-about-rust%3F&quot;&gt;What is your favorite thing/feature about Rust? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-16-member-spotlight-mainmatter/#what-is-your-favorite-thing%2Ffeature-about-rust%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our favorite thing about Rust is the combination of speed, safety and versatility. This combination enables our engineers to easily build things that would not have been possible before.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-02-08-member-spotlight-zama/member_spotlight_rand_hindi.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rand Hindi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we settle into 2022, we’re excited to share the first member spotlight of the new year. Launched in September, the member spotlight series serves as a way of introducing our growing roster of silver member companies to the wider Rust community. We’re thrilled to welcome such an interesting and diverse group of companies to the Rust Foundation family, and we look forward to seeing the Silver Member ranks grow. In today’s post we hear from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/randhindi&quot;&gt;Rand Hindi&lt;/a&gt;, Co-founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://zama.ai/&quot;&gt;Zama&lt;/a&gt;. Read on to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-us-a-bit-about-zama.&quot;&gt;Tell us a bit about Zama. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-08-member-spotlight-zama/#tell-us-a-bit-about-zama.&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Zama, we are building an open source framework for homomorphic encryption, a new data encryption approach that enables users to compute on encrypted data. It allows for the blind manipulation of data, without allowing the user to see the actual data. Our framework, &lt;a href=&quot;https://zama.ai/concrete/&quot;&gt;Concrete&lt;/a&gt;, is completely open source, built in Rust and is arguably the most advanced toolset in the space. We designed it specifically for non-cryptographers. Developers who want to use homomorphic encryption to secure the data in their applications can do that using the Concrete framework, even if they know nothing about cryptography or homomorphic encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Concrete technology is designed for building applications where sensitive data needs to be manipulated in the cloud. Think of medical products, facial recognition, blockchain, financial services, and so on. Imagine you are a company and want to use facial recognition to authenticate your users. The company that authorizes the facial recognition service would need your passport (or another official document) in a database to provide a visual match. With homomorphic encryption, you’d send an encrypted version of your passport to the facial recognition provider, they would not have the ability to decrypt it, but they could run their facial recognition algorithms on it and do a match between an encrypted photo and the encrypted passport. The user experience isn’t impacted at all, but the provider of the service no longer has access to your sensitive information – everything is truly encrypted end-to-end. To learn more and stay up to date with everything we do at Zama: &lt;a href=&quot;https://zamafhe.substack.com/&quot;&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-rust-fit-into-your-work%3F&quot;&gt;How does Rust fit into your work? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-08-member-spotlight-zama/#how-does-rust-fit-into-your-work%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been personally involved with Rust since 2015, when my previous company was using it in embedded machine learning. Rust was very young at the time and not as widely supported as it is today, but it was still a no-brainer for us. In fact, when I first discovered Rust, it was love at first sight because it fit our needs perfectly. When we started Zama, Rust was a natural choice, and we use it for almost everything – the cryptographic library, the backend, and the web services we’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-rust-made-you-fall-in-love%3F-what-are-your-favorite-features%3F&quot;&gt;What about Rust made you fall in love? What are your favorite features? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-08-member-spotlight-zama/#what-about-rust-made-you-fall-in-love%3F-what-are-your-favorite-features%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a cryptography company, we’re all about providing privacy and security and we don’t want to worry about things like bugs in the code or memory leaks. Rust is the safest language you can use for high performance, sensitive code. For me, the safety piece was a crucial part of why Rust was such a perfect fit. Rust also provides the system level performance needed for high-performance computing and mathematical computing, which is also necessary for our business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-made-you-interested-in-joining-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;What made you interested in joining the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-08-member-spotlight-zama/#what-made-you-interested-in-joining-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just wanted to get more involved in the community in general. For us, using Rust has been great for many reasons and we want to contribute whatever we can. We’re also interested in open source in general, and I feel the Rust and open source communities are closely linked. I could say the same for the privacy community – the Rust community is very privacy-centric, which is obviously important. The Foundation ticked a lot of boxes, and I enjoy having the opportunity to be a part of a community where I can have good conversations and think productively with other members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-would-you-like-to-see-the-foundation-go-in-the-coming-years%3F&quot;&gt;Where would you like to see the Foundation go in the coming years? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-08-member-spotlight-zama/#where-would-you-like-to-see-the-foundation-go-in-the-coming-years%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to see Rust replace C++. I think the Rust Foundation has an important role to play in helping Rust graduate from advanced engineering to mainstream engineering. Five or six years ago when I started with Rust, it was sort of “hipster,” something the cool people were using. Then it became a productive language, as the tooling started catching up and people started using it and online courses started catching up. Now it’s becoming approachable. The next step is making it ubiquitous and the number one language everyone uses. Why would you want to use something that is clearly inferior in terms of developer experience? A lot of contemporary thinking has gone into building Rust, and it’s time to get the language out there even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;has-rust-helped-with-any-specific-challenges%3F&quot;&gt;Has Rust helped with any specific challenges? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-08-member-spotlight-zama/#has-rust-helped-with-any-specific-challenges%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, you can make things work in any language, but sometimes it’s much more painful than it needs to be. Rust gives us a lot of peace of mind on the security side, which was a challenge with some other languages. It’s also fun to use, and it works in a very elegant way. One collateral benefit of being a Rust shop was that it has helped us recruit good talent – we were able to attract a lot of great engineers because we offered the opportunity to work in Rust. In my experience, the engineers who want to work in Rust are better than the average engineer, so it’s been a great tool for hiring talented employees. The best engineers want to use the best technologies, and Rust certainly falls into that category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-you-had-to-describe-rust-in-just-three-words%2C-what-would-they-be%3F&quot;&gt;If you had to describe Rust in just three words, what would they be? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-08-member-spotlight-zama/#if-you-had-to-describe-rust-in-just-three-words%2C-what-would-they-be%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secure, fast, and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Board Announcement: Farewell and Thanks to Florian</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-02-02-farewell-florian/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2022-02-02-farewell-florian/florian.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Florian Gilcher&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, our colleague, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Argorak&quot;&gt;Florian Gilcher&lt;/a&gt;, has taken the decision to step down from the Rust Core Team. As Florian is a Project Director and representative of the Core Team on the Rust Foundation Board of Directors, this means he will also be stepping down from that role with us. Florian has been a prominent leader in the Rust Project for many years, and was key in driving the creation of the Foundation. He has been a committed and passionate advocate for the Rust Project and its communities around the world, and instrumental in organising Rust meet-ups and events in Europe. We are sad to be losing Florian as a board member, but delighted that he will remain in the Rust Foundation family as a Silver Member through his company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ferrous-systems.com/&quot;&gt;Ferrous Systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to express our thanks to Florian for all of his work with the Foundation, and wish him the very best in his new adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Share your views - Rust Foundation Community Grants Program 2022</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-01-31-survey-rust-foundation-community-grants-program/"/>
		<updated>2022-01-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-01-31-survey-rust-foundation-community-grants-program/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you all know, the Rust Foundation is here to support the Rust Project and communities in any way that we can. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-09-news-rust-foundation-to-launch-community-grants-program/&quot;&gt;announced in December&lt;/a&gt; that one of the ways that we would do this is through our Community Grants Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Community Grants Program will be a mechanism to provide funds to the Rust development community to support their work. We want this mechanism to be fit for purpose. We want to target funding where it will be impactful. And we want to ensure that the Program is fair, inclusive and accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the process of thinking about how we achieve these goals in the way we structure the Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To inform this process, and to ensure we are targeting and prioritizing the right things, we need to hear from the people who it is designed to benefit - you. To that end, today we are opening a consultation survey on how we should shape the Community Grants Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey comprises 15 questions which are focused on how we can support you, and how we can sustain and grow the language and ecosystem. It should take between 5 - 15 minutes to complete. It will be open for responses for three weeks, until 20th February, and is available in multiple languages. Further information and an FAQ can be accessed within the survey or below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important process that will directly shape how we structure our awards, and I hope that you will share your thoughts and expertise to enable us to create a fair and impactful funding framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can provide your response to the survey here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am excited to hear your ideas, and look forward to sharing updates on the Community Grants Program once the survey has closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;information-about-the-cgp-%2F-faq&quot;&gt;Information about the CGP / FAQ &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-01-31-survey-rust-foundation-community-grants-program/#information-about-the-cgp-%2F-faq&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this FAQ we try to answer your questions about the Rust Foundation Community Grants Program Consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-the-goals-of-the-survey%3F&quot;&gt;What are the goals of the survey? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-01-31-survey-rust-foundation-community-grants-program/#what-are-the-goals-of-the-survey%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This survey seeks to identify how the Rust Foundation can most effectively target funding to support the Rust community. The survey will inform how we structure the Community Grants Program 2022, and will influence how we prioritize funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-time-will-it-take-to-answer-the-survey%3F&quot;&gt;How much time will it take to answer the survey? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-01-31-survey-rust-foundation-community-grants-program/#how-much-time-will-it-take-to-answer-the-survey%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, it should take from 5 to 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-kind-of-questions-are-included-in-the-survey%3F&quot;&gt;What kind of questions are included in the survey? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-01-31-survey-rust-foundation-community-grants-program/#what-kind-of-questions-are-included-in-the-survey%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This survey seeks your opinions on how the Rust Foundation can effectively support the Project and wider communities via its Community Grants Program. The questions range from multiple choice to free-text. Please provide as much detail as you can in your free-text answers - do not assume we will know exactly what you are referencing. No questions are compulsory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-are-you-using-this-method-to-consult%3F-why-not-a-more-public%2Fopen-method%3F&quot;&gt;Why are you using this method to consult? Why not a more public/open method? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-01-31-survey-rust-foundation-community-grants-program/#why-are-you-using-this-method-to-consult%3F-why-not-a-more-public%2Fopen-method%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are gathering opinions on the Program in a number of ways, however we want to provide an open and fair opportunity for everyone to contribute, where everyone&#39;s voice is heard equally, and in a way that individuals can be free to express opinions anonymously and without prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-will-we-use-the-data-from-the-survey-responses%3F&quot;&gt;How will we use the data from the survey responses? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-01-31-survey-rust-foundation-community-grants-program/#how-will-we-use-the-data-from-the-survey-responses%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers from the survey will be anonymized, aggregated, and summarized. A high level writeup will be posted on the Rust Foundation website. The information will then be used to shape how the Rust Foundation Community Grants Program will distribute funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-is-personally-identifiable-information-handled%3F&quot;&gt;How is personally identifiable information handled? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-01-31-survey-rust-foundation-community-grants-program/#how-is-personally-identifiable-information-handled%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly every question in the survey is optional. You are welcome to share as much or as little information as you are comfortable with. Only the Rust Foundation will have access to the raw data, and only anonymized aggregate data is shared with others. Personal information will be deleted once anonymization has taken place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your responses are subject to the Foundation’s Privacy Policy, accessible here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/privacy-policy&quot;&gt;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/privacy-policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-and-when-will-the-results-report-be-published%3F&quot;&gt;Where and when will the results report be published? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-01-31-survey-rust-foundation-community-grants-program/#where-and-when-will-the-results-report-be-published%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to publish results from the survey in mid-March 2022. The survey results will be posted to the Rust Foundation website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-you-define-what-counts-as-a-contribution-and-what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-active-contributor%3F&quot;&gt;How do you define what counts as a contribution and what does it mean to be an active contributor? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-01-31-survey-rust-foundation-community-grants-program/#how-do-you-define-what-counts-as-a-contribution-and-what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-active-contributor%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contribution is any sort of interaction that benefits the Rust Project. For example, Documentation, Code Review (PRs), Design Review (RFCs/MCPs/FCPs), Issue Triage, Issue Reporting, Moderation, New Features, Bug Fixes, Performance enhancements, Communication (e.g. writing blog posts, release notes, preparing for meetings or taking minutes), supporting/mentoring/guiding other contributors, Rollups/CI/Releases, and Governance all count as contribution, and this list is not by any means exhaustive. Anything that assists discussions, identifies issues, or otherwise benefits the project or the contributors to the project likely counts as a contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Active contributor&amp;quot; is a flexible classification that is intended to identify individuals who have contributed to the project and plan to continue to contribute to the project, regardless of how long the gap between said contributions is. If you&#39;re not sure if you&#39;re an active contributor then you&#39;re probably an active contributor, but ultimately it comes down to if you feel comfortable identifying yourself as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-difference-between-a-team%2C-working-group%2C-and-a-project-group%3F-how-can-i-tell-how-my-team%2Fgroup-is-classified%3F&quot;&gt;What is the difference between a team, working group, and a project group? How can I tell how my team/group is classified? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-01-31-survey-rust-foundation-community-grants-program/#what-is-the-difference-between-a-team%2C-working-group%2C-and-a-project-group%3F-how-can-i-tell-how-my-team%2Fgroup-is-classified%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team, working group, and project group are classifications that the project uses to loosely classify the various groups that make up the rust project. These groups are identified in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/team&quot;&gt;team repo&lt;/a&gt;, and can be disambiguated by the &lt;code&gt;kind&lt;/code&gt; field in their toml entry in the &lt;code&gt;team/teams&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;team have no &lt;code&gt;kind&lt;/code&gt; field (e.g. compiler team)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working groups have &lt;code&gt;kind = &amp;quot;working-group&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. working group polonius)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;project groups have &lt;code&gt;kind = &amp;quot;project-group&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. project group error handling)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re unsure of how the groups you&#39;re involved in are classified, check their entry in the team repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a question that is not covered here? Drop us a line at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:contact@rustfoundation.org&quot;&gt;contact@rustfoundation.org&lt;/a&gt; and we will get back to you as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Happy New Year, Rustaceans</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-01-06-happy-new-year-rustaceans-from-bec/"/>
		<updated>2022-01-06T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;HNY Rustaceans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that you all had the opportunity to take some time over the festive period to relax and spend time with family/friends/pets/yourself (dependent upon your preferences).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new year is now upon us, and I wanted to highlight a few things that will be happening at the Rust Foundation in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, I will be doing our Second Rust Foundation AMA with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nellshamrell&quot;&gt;Nell Shamrell-Harrington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sgrif&quot;&gt;Sage Griffin&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday January 11th at 12pm PT / 3pm ET / 9PM CET. This is a chance for us to answer some of your questions, talk about some of the work we are doing at the Foundation, and generally for you to get to know me a bit better. Registration for this is now open, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Ivbo08H4QpaY6vbpkECp7A&quot;&gt;all the details can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. If you can&#39;t make the live session, then not to worry, it will be recorded and uploaded onto our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0jzvznwtnsdXYIp415oC9g&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; for you to access at your leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this, our consultation exercise to inform our &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-09-news-rust-foundation-to-launch-community-grants-program/&quot;&gt;Community Grants Program&lt;/a&gt; will open on 31st January and run for three weeks, until 20th February. We have a few short questions for you which are focused on how we can support you, and how we can sustain and grow the language and ecosystem. This is an important process that will directly shape how we structure our awards, and I hope that you will share your thoughts and expertise to enable us to create a fair and impactful program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Silver &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/members/&quot;&gt;Membership&lt;/a&gt; continues to grow, and we are now at 19 members! This growth demonstrates the commitment that increasing numbers of tech companies are placing in the continued growth of the Rust Project. In line with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/bylaws/&quot;&gt;bylaws&lt;/a&gt;, Silver Members are able to elect one person to the Board of Directors of the Rust Foundation from among their number. This election will be held during the first week of February 2022, with the new board member taking a seat for the February board meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the background, I am continuing to build up the Foundation’s internal processes and organization and meeting more members of the community and membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish you all a happy and healthy 2022!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bec&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-20-member-spotlight-spectral/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2021-12-20-member-spotlight-spectral/member_spotlight_dotan_nahum.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dotan Nahum&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time for another Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/member%20spotlight/&quot;&gt;member spotlight&lt;/a&gt;, our blog series in which we’ve been introducing all our great Silver &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/members/&quot;&gt;Member companies&lt;/a&gt; to the Rust community. Today we received input from &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/jondot&quot;&gt;Dotan Nahum&lt;/a&gt;, Founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectralops.io/&quot;&gt;Spectral&lt;/a&gt;. Read on to learn about Spectral, how the company is using Rust and why it has joined the Rust Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-us-a-bit-about-spectral.-what-do-you-do-and-who-do-you-serve%3F&quot;&gt;Tell us a bit about Spectral. What do you do and who do you serve? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-20-member-spotlight-spectral/#tell-us-a-bit-about-spectral.-what-do-you-do-and-who-do-you-serve%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re a DevSecOps startup, building security products for developers that aim to help with security mistakes in codebases, data and apps. With Spectral you can cover full SDLC hardening from code to cloud, infrastructure, apps and CI/CD hardening, as well as best practices in code - all from a single CLI and a single one-pass scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-is-spectral-using-rust%3F-how-do-you-expect-to-use-it-in-the-future%3F&quot;&gt;How is Spectral using Rust? How do you expect to use it in the future? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-20-member-spotlight-spectral/#how-is-spectral-using-rust%3F-how-do-you-expect-to-use-it-in-the-future%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our core technology is Spectral Scan, which is fully built in Rust. It&#39;s a security scanner that can find security mistakes from secrets, PII in source code, documents, compiled files, binaries to security misconfiguration - a misconfigured infrastructure platform such as Kubernetes or a database such as Elastic or Postgres, and app frameworks such as Django and more. We also have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SpectralOps/keyscope&quot;&gt;Keyscope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SpectralOps/service-policy-kit&quot;&gt;service-policy-kit&lt;/a&gt; which are both written in Rust and are open source. Technologically, we do optimized I/O, machine learning, parsing, and execution optimization in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-was-spectral&#39;s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;What was Spectral&#39;s motivation to join the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-20-member-spotlight-spectral/#what-was-spectral&#39;s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust and the Rust community have been key players in realizing our technology, and we wanted to be a part of that community. Rust has been the perfect fit for the ambitious goal that we&#39;ve set for ourselves: one tool to rule them all, and the Foundation serves as a motivating and accepting community for us at Spectral. We feel obligated to give back as we move deeper into building security for developers at scale and seek out opportunities to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-in-the-months-and-years-ahead%3F&quot;&gt;What do you hope the Rust Foundation will accomplish in the months and years ahead? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-20-member-spotlight-spectral/#what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-in-the-months-and-years-ahead%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the Rust Foundation is able to give a home to all of those who&#39;ve been working around Rust voluntarily, keep the motivation, and keep steering Rust in the right direction for serving as a mission critical programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-and-how-did-you-personally-get-involved-with-rust-itself-and-how-has-your-involvement-evolved%3F&quot;&gt;When and how did you personally get involved with Rust itself and how has your involvement evolved? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-20-member-spotlight-spectral/#when-and-how-did-you-personally-get-involved-with-rust-itself-and-how-has-your-involvement-evolved%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a programming language junky, I first got to use Rust around 2014. However, at the time I bumped into stability issues so I&#39;ve parked that experiment. I later picked it up again at around 2017-2018, when the 2018 edition was starting to make headlines. There were nice docs and it felt like a successful choice for a generalist programming language that has a learning curve charted out. It soon became the language to power the core technology at my new startup, Spectral.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Make Your Voice Heard: Take the State of Rust Survey</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-15-take-the-state-of-rust-survey/"/>
		<updated>2021-12-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-15-take-the-state-of-rust-survey/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The end of the year is right around the corner, which means it’s time to think about plans and priorities for the Rust language in 2022. For those of you new to Rust, this is the time of year when the Rust Project puts out its annual State of Rust Survey, a short survey designed to gather input and opinions from current Rust users, as well as those who want to become involved with the language. The information gathered here helps the Rust Project understand how the community is growing and using the language as well as where users may be facing hurdles. It also helps the team shape its future activities, priorities and investments, to help ensure they are effectively supporting the needs of the broader Rust ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/12/08/survey-launch.html&quot;&gt;This year’s State of Rust Survey is now open&lt;/a&gt;, and your input is needed! Not a Rust programmer? No problem. The Project is looking for feedback from everyone interested in Rust’s future, even if you’re not using the language yet. Whether you’re a C-level executive whose team wants to learn more about Rust, a technical manager overseeing a group of developers, an experienced Rust programmer or you’re simply interested in learning more about the language – we want to hear from you. Any and all feedback you can give is incredibly valuable to the Rust Project as the team works to advance the language we all love so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State of Rust Survey is very much owned and directed by the Project. Here at the Rust Foundation, we recognize the value of conducting this survey, and as such we provide resources to support it, however the design and analysis of the survey is conducted independently by the Project. We want to help shine a light on its importance and encourage more people – with all types of Rust involvement – to take part. We’re thankful for the hard work of the Rust Project’s survey team in creating and running the survey, and we look forward to integrating the findings into our strategic planning for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participation is easy. It takes 10-30 minutes, and answers are completely anonymous. The survey is open to the public and available in 10 languages to help facilitate global participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take a moment to help the Rust Project out and make sure your voice is heard. This is your opportunity to help shape the future of the Rust programming language and ensure your challenges, needs and opinions are considered. Survey results are a key tool in shaping the future of the Rust Project, so this is your chance to have an impact on upcoming project plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/12/08/survey-launch.html&quot;&gt;live&lt;/a&gt; until December 22, at which point answers will be processed, analyzed and shared by the Rust Project.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-13-member-spotlight-automata/"/>
		<updated>2021-12-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-13-member-spotlight-automata/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2021-12-13-member-spotlight-automata/member_spotlight_deli_gong.png&quot; alt=&quot;Deli Gong&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief hiatus, we’re excited to be back with another entry in our member spotlight blog series and another introduction to one of our great Rust Foundation members. Each post in this series is designed to introduce the community to a new member company, sharing details on its work, its use of Rust and its hope for the language going forward. In today’s installment, we received input from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gongdeli/&quot;&gt;Deli Gong&lt;/a&gt;, Co-Founder at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ata.network/&quot;&gt;Automata Network&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what he had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduce-us-to-automata-network.-what-do-you-do-and-who-do-you-serve%3F&quot;&gt;Introduce us to Automata Network. What do you do and who do you serve? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-13-member-spotlight-automata/#introduce-us-to-automata-network.-what-do-you-do-and-who-do-you-serve%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those who are new to us, Automata Network is a decentralized service protocol that provides middleware services for applications and blockchains so they are able to achieve traceless privacy, high assurance and frictionless computation. To break that down further, there are essentially two components to why we do what we do. The first is that we are firm advocates of a fair Web 3.0. We foresee privacy playing an important role in safeguarding a future that is collectively owned by the people who build it, and the people who use it. That’s important to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we believe in a multi-chain Web 3.0 universe, but native applications and blockchains don’t often come built-in with the kind of privacy features designed in mind for the end-user. Several products in our technology suite are designed with privacy protection in mind, such as Witness, which offers off-chain governance, or Conveyor, a solution that tackles front-running on the blockchain. Most recently, we also celebrated the launch of XATA, a Fair Liquidity Provisioning Protocol that is powered by none other than Conveyor. So, we’re taking concrete steps towards that privacy-first future we originally envisioned, and we are very excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automata Network is also currently hiring across several departments to boost our ranks and bring this important vision to life. If you’re keen, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://ata.network/careers&quot;&gt;our careers site&lt;/a&gt; to find out more and join us in delivering the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tell-us-a-bit-about-how-automata-is-using-rust.-how-do-you-expect-to-use-it-in-the-future%3F&quot;&gt;Tell us a bit about how Automata is using Rust. How do you expect to use it in the future? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-13-member-spotlight-automata/#tell-us-a-bit-about-how-automata-is-using-rust.-how-do-you-expect-to-use-it-in-the-future%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a point in blockchain technologies where the immutability of things are often shouted about, and that’s great, but there’s a lot of fine deliberation that goes into the work. When code is written almost in a one-way function, especially in DeFi, once it’s done, it’s done. There are no edits or adjustments you can make to a smart contract once it’s deployed, so there’s a lot of emphasis on the language being used - and Rust is a great programming language. For example, with Rust, there is a set of semantic rules enforced within the language to prevent bugs, and that’s really helpful in helping developers not write code that eventually fails, even if the program runs. When we think of it as being functional, we consider Rust as a language that really makes it quite hard to mess it up, just because it’s built to highlight any errors at the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this popularity, we think, also comes from a real desire we are seeing from developers who realize blockchain projects and ecosystems are here to stay, and who are starting to take notice of Rust as their programming language of choice. Polkadot, for instance, is built on an open-source framework called Substrate, which is Rust based, so there’s also a natural inclination there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-was-automata&#39;s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;What was Automata&#39;s motivation to join the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-13-member-spotlight-automata/#what-was-automata&#39;s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers seem to really enjoy the language, but that’s not to say that there hasn’t been a relatively steep learning curve with Rust. With our participation and close alignment with some of the more active and biggest blockchain communities out there, we aim to help support developers on their journey as they start learning more about Rust - things they wished they might have known from the beginning, hurdles as they start being fully productive, finding the right resources to build on their knowledge, and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently we published the first of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/atanetwork/ask-automata-create-custom-rpc-subscription-in-substrate-c8c90bfd2616&quot;&gt;#AskAutomata technical series&lt;/a&gt; and the first article was a how to guide on creating a custom RPC subscription in Substrate, which is built on the Rust programming language. We want to create more tutorials and developer documentation to help the community get the most out of their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-in-the-months-and-years-ahead%3F&quot;&gt;What do you hope the Rust Foundation will accomplish in the months and years ahead? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-13-member-spotlight-automata/#what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-in-the-months-and-years-ahead%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust language official slogan is, “A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software,” but we happened to also read that an earlier version of that sentiment was penned down as, “A language empowering everyone, but especially folks who thought that systems programming wasn’t for them.” Rust is a promising technology, and we at Automata hope to continue the same collaborative spirit that has served the programming language from its inception by making it accessible to a wider and growing community. The development work around Rust is super important. We believe the Foundation&#39;s continued success will come from supporting that work in addition to the valuable marketing, documentation and team-building efforts that make a community thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-and-how-did-you-personally-get-involved-with-rust-itself-and-how-has-your-involvement-evolved%3F&quot;&gt;When and how did you personally get involved with Rust itself and how has your involvement evolved? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-13-member-spotlight-automata/#when-and-how-did-you-personally-get-involved-with-rust-itself-and-how-has-your-involvement-evolved%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a C/C++ developer for quite some time, I got addicted to Rust the first time I ran into it. I didn’t feel a steep learning curve thanks to a few nice getting-started guides and books from the Rust community. It didn’t take too long to go from playing around with some hobby projects to building our own technical solutions. When we founded the Automata Network, it was quite natural to use Rust as it works well in offering low-level primitives as well as high-level frameworks. The best part is that we have all we need from the open-source community and it’s just the right time to build ours and contribute back to the community.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Rust Foundation to Launch Community Grants Program</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-09-news-rust-foundation-to-launch-community-grants-program/"/>
		<updated>2021-12-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-09-news-rust-foundation-to-launch-community-grants-program/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dec. 9, 2021 WAKEFIELD, Mass – The &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, an independent non-profit dedicated to supporting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust Project&lt;/a&gt;, today announced that it will soon launch its Community Grants Program, providing access to new resources for the Rust community to maintain, innovate, collaborate, and develop the Rust language. The Community Grants Program will be used to thoughtfully and purposefully support the continued expansion of Rust, strategically addressing key areas for development across the Rust ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With continued, widespread adoption of the Rust programming language, the Rust developer community is the fastest growing in the last two years&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-09-news-rust-foundation-to-launch-community-grants-program/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the work of the engineers maintaining and contributing to the open source Rust Project and its ecosystem remains in high demand. Financial support from the Rust Foundation will focus on impactful and sustainable work that best demonstrates the remarkable capabilities of Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation Community Grants Program is made possible by the generous support of corporate partners, with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, and Huawei amongst the first contributors. A strategic framework is in development to target funds, structure the application and distribution process, and define success metrics, ensuring the Program delivers value and impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The purpose of the Rust Foundation will always be to support the highly dedicated, innovative and talented community that makes the Rust language so successful,” said Rebecca Rumbul, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer at the Rust Foundation. “Financial support via our Community Grants Program is just one of many strategic initiatives that the Foundation will utilize to empower the community and develop the ecosystem. We look forward to consulting with the community on their priorities for the Foundation, and sharing detailed information on the grant application process in the weeks ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of a Community Grants Program is only the latest new initiative from the Rust Foundation that is designed to support the growth and development of the Rust community. The Foundation recently announced financing for a team of programmers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/posts/2021-10-18-crates-io-oncall-ferrous-systems/&quot;&gt;manage the 24/7 on-call support for the Crates.io service&lt;/a&gt;. It also launched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-11-16-news-announcing-cloud-compute-initiative/&quot;&gt;Rust Foundation Cloud Compute Program&lt;/a&gt; to provide free compute for Rust maintainers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A large part of the current success of the Rust Project is due to the vibrant community and volunteers who contribute not only to engineering tasks, but to all aspects of making the Project successful,” said Lars Bergstrom, Google Director of Engineering. “We believe that one way that the Rust Foundation can best support the Rust Project is through providing Community Grants to those critical volunteers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation Community Grants Program is made stronger through diverse corporate sponsorship, and the Foundation welcomes additional contributions from interested corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Love for Rust at re:Invent</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-06-love-for-rust-at-reinvent/"/>
		<updated>2021-12-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-06-love-for-rust-at-reinvent/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I settle into the ED &amp;amp; CEO role here at the Rust Foundation, one of my priorities is to meet as many Rust stakeholders as possible, which includes (but is of course not limited to) Community and Project members, Corporate members, our peers in the Open Source space, and potential adopters and new entrants to Rust. I do this because I need to build up a comprehensive picture of the many different interests and needs we are committed to support and champion as the Rust Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting people face to face and having thoughtful and organic conversations is a valuable way to get real insight, however our Rust community is spread across the globe, which makes face to face meetings slightly more challenging. Large conferences/conventions have the advantage of gathering groups of Rust enthusiasts in one place, and so from time to time, to take advantage of this, I will be attending these events to connect with our different constituencies. These events also provide useful opportunities to promote Rust, to excite people about the new opportunities and efficiencies of the Rust language, and to grow our community and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, AWS hosted its annual re:Invent conference, a truly mammoth gathering, which brought together many Rustaceans and which also provided a platform for Rust engineers to talk publicly about how safe, high performance, and sustainable Rust is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Chair, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SkippersWif&quot;&gt;Shane Miller&lt;/a&gt;, along with Rust grandee and Tokio author Carl Lerche, kicked off the week with a game-changing talk on Rust for sustainability. When I say ‘game-changing’ I’m not referring to our Rust corner of the open source world, I’m talking about a game-changer for our entire global digital infrastructure. Shane and Carl demonstrated how much more energy efficient Rust is compared to every other language, with Rust emerging as approximately 50% more energy efficient than Java, and a whopping 98% more efficient than Python. Only C was comparable in terms of efficiency, and, let’s face it, no amount of energy efficiency is going to make that attractive to build in, when you consider how much more in terms of memory and concurrency safety you get with Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that people don’t get into engineering or development for a love of environmental issues, and that energy efficiency in and of itself might not feel terribly exciting, but our digital infrastructure uses 1% of global energy, which is huge, and global data center use is only going to grow. Use of Rust can therefore make a significant contribution to reducing energy usage and the climate-related impacts that go with it. This will form part of the narrative of Rust going forward, and it adds yet another attractive reason for individuals and corporations to choose and invest in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust as a high performance, sustainable, and secure language was namechecked in a number of different sessions at re:Invent. As Amazon CTO Werner Vogels said in his keynote, “I&#39;ve seen an enormous interest in Rust especially also when it comes to issues of sustainability, making use of the most sustainable programming languages out there.&amp;quot; It was great to see how much love for Rust is out there, and AWS is clearly committed to the use of Rust and to investing in the community and Project through its support of the Rust Foundation. Rust engineers attending also gave me great insight into their roles and experiences of being part of the community, and these insights will help me serve you all better. I should particularly thank Rust wizards Carl Lerche, Felix Klock and Jon Gjengset for not facepalming every time I asked a daft question, which I did with disappointing regularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were unable to catch the talks virtually last week, we will share them via the usual social media channels once they become publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a great opportunity to promote Rust and the Foundation, to get new and exciting narratives about Rust out into the world, and for me personally to learn about how Rust is being used. I look forward to attending similar events held in the coming months, and hope to see some of you there!&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-11-17-news-announcing-rebecca-rumbul-executive-director-ceo/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nov. 17, 2021 WAKEFIELD, Mass – The &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, an independent non-profit dedicated to supporting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust Project&lt;/a&gt;, today announced the appointment of &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/posts/2021-11-17-introducing-rebecca-rumbul/&quot;&gt;Rebecca Rumbul&lt;/a&gt; as the organization’s Executive Director and CEO. Rumbul will lead the new non-profit as it pushes forward with an ambitious agenda to support the work of Rust language maintainers, a global community that governs and develops the Rust programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumbul comes to the Rust Foundation with deep expertise in international non-profit management and as a leading, global advocate for digital democracy and information rights. Rumbul most recently served as Director of Research and Engagement at mySociety, where she worked to bring transparency to governance and parliamentary systems within government, NGOs, and commercial enterprises around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rust Foundation has built a strong, strategic base in our first year, and Rebecca Rumbul is ideally suited to lead the organization as we build on this with more programs and initiatives to connect and support the work of the Rust Project,” said Rust Foundation Chair Shane Miller, who is also Senior Engineering Manager at Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS). “Bec combines deep, relevant experience with passion, as well as a warm collaborative style that make her a great fit, as we seek to match the needs of the Rust community with the resources of Rust Foundation members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumbul has extensive background working on executive and academic boards, having served as a Council member at the Advertising Standards Authority, as a Trustee at the Hansard Society and as the UK representative claimant at the Privacy Collective. She holds a PhD in politics, public administration and program governance, an MSc in public administration, and a bachelor’s in humanities, each from the Open University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rust community are doing important, inspiring work with the Rust programming language, and I am excited to be part of a collaboration that will have a significant impact on the world,” said Rumbul. “Rust’s core features position it to be globally impactful, including supporting the advancement of security and sustainability initiatives. It’s an honor to be a part of that and I look forward to joining this transformative community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rebecca brings deep leadership experience in nonprofit and digital governance,” said Bobby Holley, who chaired the Executive Director Search Committee, and who is also a member of the Rust Foundation Board of Directors and a Distinguished Engineer at Mozilla. “She’s a smart, collaborative leader with the vision and grit to build out the Rust Foundation and deliver the impact we’re here to make.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Holley, the Executive Director Search Committee consisted of Shane Miller, Josh Stone, Project Director and Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, Mark Rousskov, Project Director, Core Team and Rust Foundation Secretary, and Tyler Mandry, Project Director and Senior Software Engineer at Google.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Hello Everyone! How Can I Help?</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-11-17-introducing-rebecca-rumbul/"/>
		<updated>2021-11-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-11-17-introducing-rebecca-rumbul/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, all. &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-11-17-news-announcing-rebecca-rumbul-executive-director-ceo/&quot;&gt;I am delighted to join the Rust Foundation as Executive Director and CEO&lt;/a&gt;. This is a huge and exciting role for me and for the Rust Foundation, and I feel privileged to have the opportunity to support such a broad, innovative and collaborative community. I am eager to get started, and hope to meet as many of you as possible in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little about me in the meantime – I’m Welsh, based in Cardiff, and have worked in and around international tech/policy/politics for the last 15 or so years. I join the Rust Foundation from mySociety, a civic tech open source platform developer, where I worked in impact, research, community building and senior management. I founded the TICTeC civic tech community, which has grown to become a global multi-annual programme and event series, and on the side, I support The Hansard Society as a Trustee, am a Non-Executive Director of the UK Advertising Standards Authority and work with the UK Privacy Collective on legal routes to redress for data privacy violations. I’ve worked in partnership with parliaments and governments all over the world, as well as with leading universities and tech organizations such as Google and Meta (formerly Facebook). I’m confident that these various experiences have positioned me well to serve the Rust project and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure, I am not currently a Rust programmer. Nor am I able to code in any other languages. Practically, I don’t anticipate this as an issue, as this role is one designed to provide strategic leadership and operational support. Having worked with coders for years, I am familiar with many of the concepts, practices and of the broader landscape of languages, and am therefore confident that my lack of language skill will not present a problem. I recognize how game-changing Rust is, and I am committed to championing it as your ED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect what is more interesting to you all right now, is what this appointment means for the Rust Project and community going forward. My ambition for this role is to build a lot of the institutional infrastructure necessary to safeguard Rust’s growth and sustainability, and to develop a strategy that will thoughtfully and purposefully guide that growth and open up new opportunities. In these early days, this will cover setting up financial and operational processes, building a team of the right people to contribute to this and working with the Board and the community to develop our strategic goals. Longer term, this will include attracting investment, developing partnerships and exploring how to sustainably and effectively support a growing community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a leadership role, but it is one that is in service to you, the community, which means my priority is understanding what I as ED and the Foundation as a whole, should be doing to enable Rust to flourish. I was attracted to Rust because it is all about collaboration, and while the Foundation will provide practical support and organization, in these early days I want to work closely with you all to shape our strategic goals. These goals will shape our joint future, and set the direction of growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key area is in financial support to the community, projects and teams. I understand how eager you all are to see real and meaningful movement from the Foundation as soon as possible. I will be prioritizing developing frameworks for community grants and financial support, but this will take some time. Please bear with me, as I want to develop fair, coherent, and purposeful strategic funding frameworks to maximize the impact of our support. In order for these instruments to target support effectively, we will need your input. A consultation process will begin very soon to enable you to provide your thoughts, advice and expertise to help shape our approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust has already come a very long way given its youth, but I see a lot of further opportunity in the future. I am excited about exploring that future with you all. I am planning to host an AMA session online soon so that I can answer any and all of your questions, and I look forward to working with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bec&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Rust Foundation Announces Cloud Compute Program</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-11-16-news-announcing-cloud-compute-initiative/"/>
		<updated>2021-11-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-11-16-news-announcing-cloud-compute-initiative/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nov. 16, 2021 WAKEFIELD, Mass – The &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, an independent non-profit dedicated to supporting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust Project&lt;/a&gt;, today announced the Rust Foundation Cloud Compute Program, a new initiative to provide free compute for Rust Project maintainers around the world. Through infrastructure credits provided by Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Rust maintainers will have free access to high-powered, cloud compute that will dramatically reduce the time spent building and testing language changes and updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid adoption of the Rust programming language has made the Rust developer community the fastest growing in the last two years&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-11-16-news-announcing-cloud-compute-initiative/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and created unprecedented demand for the work of the engineers maintaining and contributing to the open source Rust Project and its ecosystem. Committing code to the Rust Project is a multi-step process where one change request frequently takes as long as an hour to complete, usually tying up maintainers’ private, local machines. Today, compiling the Rust compiler on a 4-core CPU, that is typically found in a standard laptop, takes up to 15 minutes with another 5-10 minutes for tests. However, a 96-core cloud virtual machine can complete the same build in less than five minutes with tests completing in 35 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Rust Foundation Cloud Compute Program, maintainers will have access to cloud compute around the world to build and test code, enabling them to be more efficient in their development of Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The momentum behind the Rust programming language is undeniable, and it is critical to recognize and support the dedicated Rust maintainers, many of whom are volunteers,” said Rust Foundation Chairwoman Shane Miller, who is also a Senior Engineering Manager at AWS. “Giving all maintainers access to powerful cloud compute will mean that developers are spending their time on code, not waiting for builds. This can save the Rust compiler team thousands of hours every month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The stated focus of the Rust Foundation is to support the set of highly dedicated and talented maintainers that govern and develop the project,” said Joel Marcey, Member Director at the Rust Foundation and Staff Developer Advocate at Meta (formerly Facebook). “It is my hope that providing these free cloud-based computing resources will be just one of many Foundation initiatives that enable a new level of efficiency, productivity and happiness for those working on the Rust core.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nell Shamrell-Harrington, Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft and Rust Foundation Member Director added, “An Open Source ecosystem is only as strong as its maintainers and their ability to contribute. We are proud to provide compute power on Microsoft Azure to support the continued development of the Rust language.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Rust Foundation Achieves Significant Milestone with 15th Silver Member Organization</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-11-02-news-fifteenth-silver-member/"/>
		<updated>2021-11-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-11-02-news-fifteenth-silver-member/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nov. 2, 2021 WAKEFIELD, Mass – The &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, an independent non-profit dedicated to supporting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust Project&lt;/a&gt;, recently welcomed its 15th Silver Member. The addition was part of a rapid expansion of the Foundation’s membership roster, with companies including Arm, Sentry, Knóldus, Spectral, Automata, Activision, and Toyota Connected all joining over the past few months. The 15th Silver Member represents a milestone that validates the importance of the Rust Foundation’s purpose and demonstrates the extraordinary faith that prominent high-tech institutions are placing in the continued application and growth of the Rust Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech world’s rapid adoption of the Rust programming language has made the Rust developer community one of the fastest growing for more than a year and created unprecedented demand for the work of the engineers maintaining and contributing to the Rust open source project and ecosystem. Finding a way to channel support to the Rust project is the mission of the Rust Foundation, which was founded as a partnership between AWS, Google, Huawei, Microsoft, and Mozilla earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving the milestone of 15 Silver Members is a testament to the value of the Rust Foundation’s investment in programs that directly impact the community of Rust maintainers – the individuals who are the lifeblood of the Rust programming language. This support includes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/posts/2021-10-18-crates-io-oncall-ferrous-systems/&quot;&gt;Rust Foundation’s recent funding of infrastructure on-call support for Rust Project maintainers&lt;/a&gt;, relieving a team of volunteers from the 24/7 support they’ve provided for over ten billion downloads of more than 69,000 crates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rust programming language makes it possible for developers to build secure and sustainable software,” said Rust Foundation Chairwoman Shane Miller, who also leads the Rust team at Amazon Web Services. “The Rust Foundation creates a platform for companies benefiting from the value of Rust to contribute to maintainer health and wealth, ecosystem completeness and stability, and growing the developer community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation model is inspired by the collaborative spirit that has defined the Rust Project. This includes direct representation from the Rust Project’s governance through both Core team representatives and project area directors, who join with the representatives from Rust Foundation’s member companies to form a board of directors that guides the Rust Foundation&#39;s activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We build software that will potentially run on all future Toyota cars in North America. Combining Deep Learning and the efficiency and security Rust delivers is something our developers are extremely excited about,” said Ryan Wheeler, Executive Director of Engineering at Toyota Connected. “More efficient programming means better-performing software, which is great for developers, great for our customers, and great for our company. Finding a way to further contribute to this effort through the Rust Foundation just made sense for Toyota Connected.”&lt;br /&gt;
The new Silver Members join a diverse roster of companies building on and supporting Rust, including Clever Cloud, Ferrous Systems, Futurewei, KDAB, Open Source Security, ParaState, Tag1, and Zama. Platinum members include Google, Amazon Web Services, Huawei, Mozilla, Meta (formerly Facebook), and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Software is increasingly important in realizing the full potential of computing today,” said Andrew Wafaa, Senior Director of Software Communities, Arm. “The Rust programming language is delivering on the performance, reliability, and efficiency software principles needed for the next era of computing, and as a new member of the Rust Foundation, Arm is committed to contributing to the growth and development of the Rust programming language alongside other leaders in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation will be hosting its first quarterly AMA on November 16th at 9am PT/12pm ET. Please join hosts Mark Rousskov, Secretary and Project Director, Core and Shane Miller, Chairwoman and Member Director, Amazon Web Services as they share the latest Foundation updates and answer questions from the community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_BNOwcv_TS7aMpGNGEaTgEQ&quot;&gt;Register here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our clients include Google, Fortive, Capgemini, The NY Times, Al Jazeera, &lt;a href=&quot;http://whitehouse.gov/&quot;&gt;Whitehouse.gov&lt;/a&gt;, the ACLU, the Linux Foundation, Stanford University, The University of Michigan and many other great organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mandry%3A-tell-us-about-tag1%E2%80%99s-use-of-rust.-what-are-you-working-on-currently-and-do-you-have-any-plans-you%E2%80%99d-like-to-share%3F&quot;&gt;Mandry: Tell us about Tag1’s use of Rust. What are you working on currently and do you have any plans you’d like to share? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-26-member-spotlight-tag1/#mandry%3A-tell-us-about-tag1%E2%80%99s-use-of-rust.-what-are-you-working-on-currently-and-do-you-have-any-plans-you%E2%80%99d-like-to-share%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrews&lt;/strong&gt;: We started using Rust to improve internal tools and processes. We ported a number of scripts and utilities that were originally written in Python and were increasingly impressed by the dramatic gains in performance and reliability. We spend much less time debugging problems with the Rust versions of these internal tools, and we can rapidly deploy updates when remote APIs change or we need new functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our primary contribution to the community is &lt;a href=&quot;https://goose.rs/&quot;&gt;Goose&lt;/a&gt;, a highly-scalable load testing tool inspired by Locust. Many of our clients operate at an extremely large scale, and reliably load testing at these scales with a Python-based tool created its own challenges. By creating Goose, thanks to its Rust underpinnings, we have solved these headaches and can easily operate at the scale we require. It has continued to mature and gain additional features, described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://book.goose.rs/&quot;&gt;The Goose Book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are seeing growing interest from the community with requests for new functionality and added flexibility. We will introduce a graphical user interface for Goose soon, making it easier to run load tests and analyze the results. We&#39;re continuing to expand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.rs/goose-eggs/&quot;&gt;Goose Eggs library&lt;/a&gt;, which has already proven to be helpful in quickly developing powerful load tests. Finally, the more we use Rust the more we continue to improve the underlying load testing codebase, embracing best practices and new features available in the rapidly evolving language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mandry%3A-what-was-tag1%E2%80%99s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;Mandry: What was Tag1’s motivation to join the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-26-member-spotlight-tag1/#mandry%3A-what-was-tag1%E2%80%99s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrews&lt;/strong&gt;: We first explored this question &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tag1consulting.com/blog/tag1-joins-rust-foundation-first-silver-member&quot;&gt;in our blog where we announced our membership in the Rust Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. We remain strong believers in Open Source Software. As long-time contributors to Drupal and the Drupal Association, we&#39;ve seen how effective stewardship can greatly benefit a community. Joining the Rust Foundation echoes our excitement for Rust itself, we want to see it and the community around it grow and thrive. Rust is already known for its excellent documentation and its passionate and helpful community. We are very proud to be even a small part of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mandry%3A-what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-in-the-future%3F&quot;&gt;Mandry: What do you hope the Rust Foundation will accomplish in the future? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-26-member-spotlight-tag1/#mandry%3A-what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-in-the-future%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrews&lt;/strong&gt;: The Rust Foundation will be critical to the success and growth of the project and community. We hope that the Rust Foundation will encourage users to continue creating new things with the language, promote new features and uses and advocate for the community. The Foundation will be essential to fundraising, supporting and scaling the project. It will also help organize conferences and bring the community together, as well as help build a robust ecosystem around the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mandry%3A-what-is-your-personal-involvement-with-rust%3F-do-you-consider-yourself-a-rustacean%3F-please-tell-us-a-bit-about-your-involvement-with-the-language.&quot;&gt;Mandry: What is your personal involvement with Rust? Do you consider yourself a Rustacean? Please tell us a bit about your involvement with the language. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-26-member-spotlight-tag1/#mandry%3A-what-is-your-personal-involvement-with-rust%3F-do-you-consider-yourself-a-rustacean%3F-please-tell-us-a-bit-about-your-involvement-with-the-language.&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrews&lt;/strong&gt;: My first six months of learning Rust was an odd combination of overwhelming frustration mixed with just enough moments of happiness to keep me using it. At times, it felt like the compiler was constantly fighting me, forcing me to change decades of learned habits. At the same time, there was profound satisfaction each time I managed to get my code to compile and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I stopped fighting the compiler and fully embraced the patterns it was teaching me. I also enabled Clippy on all my projects, open source and internal, and look forward to new versions introducing new improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when I need to program in other languages, I find I miss the strictness of the Rust compiler! I often adapt Rust patterns into tools I maintain in other languages. And whenever possible, I use Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not made the time yet to contribute to the compiler or the standard Rust toolchain, but this is still something on my programming bucket list.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Adios Pagers: New Developments on Crates.io</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-18-crates-io-oncall-ferrous-systems/"/>
		<updated>2021-10-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-18-crates-io-oncall-ferrous-systems/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tmandry&quot;&gt;Tyler Mandry&lt;/a&gt;, Quality Director, Rust Foundation and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yaahc/&quot;&gt;Jane Lusby&lt;/a&gt;, Project Director, Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2021-10-18-crates-io-oncall-ferrous-systems/crates-io.png&quot; alt=&quot;Crates.io&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this post, you’re probably familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt; and its significance in the Rust ecosystem. If you write Rust code using Cargo, you’ve certainly downloaded a crate from &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;crates.io&lt;/a&gt; to use in your project, and hopefully your experience has been positive. A LOT of stuff runs on top of &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt;, and Rust developers around the world depend on it to support their projects. In fact, as of this publication, &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt; has seen over &lt;strong&gt;ten billion downloads&lt;/strong&gt; and now hosts &lt;strong&gt;69,000+ crates&lt;/strong&gt;! Pretty impressive numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt; is maintained by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/crates-io&quot;&gt;talented and dedicated group of volunteers&lt;/a&gt; who are responsible for improving the service. Until recently, this team was also responsible for troubleshooting issues and ensuring it always ran as needed. This was a 24/7 responsibility, which meant rotating pager duty among the volunteers to be sure issues were addressed quickly and Rust developers didn’t experience downtime. On behalf of the roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-languages-javascript-has-most-developers-but-rust-is-the-fastest-growing/&quot;&gt;1.3MM members&lt;/a&gt; of the Rust community, we want to take a moment to say thank you to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt; team for your amazing support. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talked to the team, however, it became clear that they could use some assistance, particularly with the on-call element. So, we reached out to a number of individuals and contractors who had the skills to provide it and asked if they could help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, we’re delighted to share that &lt;a href=&quot;https://ferrous-systems.com/&quot;&gt;Ferrous Systems&lt;/a&gt;, a team of Rust programming consultants, has taken over responsibility for the on-call rotation necessary to ensure that &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt; is always accessible. The Rust Foundation is financing a team of four programmers from Ferrous Systems that will act as a “first line of defense” for keeping the server up and running. They’ll be on rotation at all times to ensure continual coverage and quick, seamless issue resolution, so that programmers around the globe will be unaware of – and uninterrupted by – any service hiccups. The improvements have already been well received. Justin Geibel, a lead of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt; team, recently shared the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend I attended a wedding (and then took a recovery day) without having to worry that my laptop was nearby in case there was a page. Thank you for getting this secured. It has been a huge reduction in stress knowing that a capable team is available and ready to respond to any incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt; team will continue to own the &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt; project and will remain focused on improving the service and responding to the community. Ferrous Systems isn’t replacing the team by any stretch, nor is it joining the team. The addition of Ferrous Systems is to support the &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt; volunteers, free them up to focus on other projects that will advance the service, and ensure they’re not tethered to their laptops by the on-call pager. While these volunteers once had to be on call 24/7, they can now have more autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing this added stress from the volunteers in this group is so important, both for their well-being and for their longevity as active users and contributors in the Rust community. The broader Rust community benefits here as well, from improved &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt; reliability and faster resolution of any issues that do arise. The Ferrous Systems team has also been tasked with some development work to enhance the reliability of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt; service, which will benefit all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt; to Rust and the Rust community cannot be overstated. It’s the foundation for so much great Rust development and is depended on by developers across the globe. As the Rust community continues to grow, we’re happy to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;Crates.io&lt;/a&gt; evolve and mature to better deliver on Rust’s promise of empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation is growing fast! And as we expand our membership base, we are also expanding our member spotlight series. Designed to help our audience get better acquainted with member companies, this series dives into the details of each member, its use of Rust, its interest in the Foundation, and what they hope we’ll accomplish going forward. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SkippersWif&quot;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; recently shared some questions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhavya-aggarwal-680929a/&quot;&gt;Bhavya Aggarwal&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.knoldus.com/home&quot;&gt;Knoldus, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; Check out his thoughts below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;miller%3A-tell-us-a-bit-about-knoldus.-what-do-you-do-and-who-do-you-serve%3F&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SkippersWif&quot;&gt;Miller&lt;/a&gt;: Tell us a bit about Knoldus. What do you do and who do you serve? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-07-member-spotlight-knoldus/#miller%3A-tell-us-a-bit-about-knoldus.-what-do-you-do-and-who-do-you-serve%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggarwal&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.knoldus.com/home&quot;&gt;Knoldus&lt;/a&gt; engineers high-performance systems, data strategy and analytics and intelligence-driven systems with a product mindset to make businesses succeed with technology.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;miller%3A-how-is-knoldus-using-rust%3F&quot;&gt;Miller: How is Knoldus using Rust? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-07-member-spotlight-knoldus/#miller%3A-how-is-knoldus-using-rust%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggarwal&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.knoldus.com/accelerators/technology/rust&quot;&gt;Knoldus has embraced Rust since 2019&lt;/a&gt; and implemented it in all aspects of development, from source control to compilers. One of the main reasons for our interest in Rust was to build highly performant systems because of its better safety standards that decrease the development process cost. Rust has been making its mark in multiple areas like Embedded programming, Networking, CLI, Web Assemblies and Blockchains. Knoldus has been successfully contributing to these areas and some of the achievements are discussed in detail below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerb - Kerb is a consumer location intelligence platform designed to measure the flow of consumers. The platform uses an AI-powered camera that maps and measures the pedestrian foot traffic flow on sidewalks to calculate total potential customers, customers captured, potential leads, intent to buy metrics for each potential lead and demographics of each potential lead, enabling businesses to measure footfall insights. The Jetson Nano devices were used for edge computing and all the services to capture the relevant data like Stereo Images, GPS, Accelerometer, etc. were built on Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polkadex - Polkadex is a dedicated blockchain for decentralized exchange, which is purpose-built and configured to optimize the performance of DEXs. Polkadex solves the problem of low liquidity by having AMMs directly connected to its trading engine. These AMMs act as On-Chain market-making bots. Polkadex provides two ways to bring liquidity, Polkadot Parachain, and Snowfork trustless Ethereum Bridge. Polkadex para chain will have just one functionality to bridge liquidity to and from Polkadot to Polkadex. The platform is made using the Substrate Blockchain Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embedded Engineering - Knoldus has developed two major products:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image Recognition System for Attendance Management and Security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference Monitor - An IoT-based system for monitoring the conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are working on building the edge computing solutions for our own IoT Platform called Knurons and have been able to supply various sensor data using devices like Jetson Nano, Raspberry PI as well as devices having STM32F3Discovery Microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Networking - Knoldus have built an internal product for monitoring activities of network protocols like DHCP (Domain Host Configuration Protocol) &amp;amp; AD (Active Directories). The product has the ability to monitor any type of logs and is completely configurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLI - To test the powers of Rust Programming, we have developed a tool that monitors the system’s processes and terminates them when they go beyond their configured memory consumption limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Assembly – We have developed some POCs to understand the concepts more thoroughly. POCs include hosting wasm modules in JS, building checkers games, hosting wasm modules on RaspberryPi and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust Compiler – Knoldus has also been contributing to the Rust compiler (rustc) to make it more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;miller%3A-how-do-you-expect-that-to-change%3F&quot;&gt;Miller: How do you expect that to change? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-07-member-spotlight-knoldus/#miller%3A-how-do-you-expect-that-to-change%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggarwal&lt;/strong&gt;: Previously we were involved on the application level only where we developed a few products, but now we are more focused on the system-level programming. Since Rust programming overcomes the pitfalls of C &amp;amp; C++ and the most powerful feature is it guarantees memory safety, which is the pain point for C &amp;amp; C++ where we need to handle all the memory by ourselves, we decided to make use of these features and build highly performant and intelligent systems. We are working on the development of embedded software for the IoT platforms and also trying to use the core capabilities of Rust programming in the Networking, Web Assemblies and CLI area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;miller%3A-what-was-knoldus%E2%80%99s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;Miller: What was Knoldus’s motivation to join the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-07-member-spotlight-knoldus/#miller%3A-what-was-knoldus%E2%80%99s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggarwal&lt;/strong&gt;: At Knoldus, we always try to incorporate cutting-edge technologies into our tech stack. We have been functional programmers for the last 10 years and are primarily invested in Scala and Haskell. For many of our engineers, Rust was a language that we evaluated and loved. Since the advent of Rust, it has been on a path to growth, and like the Rust Foundation, which  supports Rust programming, Knoldus also has the same vision to always contribute to the community. The prime motivation behind Knoldus joining the Foundation is that we both believe Rust is the future of Systems Programming and together we can support the Rust project in its work to move Rust forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;miller%3A-what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-in-the-months-and-years-ahead%3F&quot;&gt;Miller: What do you hope the Rust Foundation will accomplish in the months and years ahead? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-07-member-spotlight-knoldus/#miller%3A-what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-in-the-months-and-years-ahead%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggarwal&lt;/strong&gt;: The Rust Foundation has been playing a pivotal role in promoting Rust programming across the globe. We anticipate the Rust Foundation will provide a centralized platform to the Rust community to make the Rust ecosystem more mature and contribute towards the growth of the Rust programming language. This centralized platform is already supervised by competent maintainers. The coming together of industry giants behind Rust Foundation lays the groundwork for successful adoption and appeal for the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;miller%3A-when-and-how-did-you-personally-get-involved-with-rust-itself-and-how-has-your-involvement-evolved%3F&quot;&gt;Miller: When and how did you personally get involved with Rust itself and how has your involvement evolved? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-07-member-spotlight-knoldus/#miller%3A-when-and-how-did-you-personally-get-involved-with-rust-itself-and-how-has-your-involvement-evolved%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggarwal&lt;/strong&gt;: We started exploring Rust programming in 2019 to leverage its powers over C &amp;amp; C++  in areas like no memory management issues. Where Rust catches any misuse of memory at the compile-time only, it also provides high performance, which is because of the absence of a garbage collector and so many other features, like cross-platform support, rich ecosystem, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, we started small with Rust by understanding the language and developing capabilities around its ecosystem, and then we built some in-house solutions like Attendance Management and Network scanning tools for our internal use. Fortunately, we got a chance to work on full-scale Rust development projects, which helped us to delve more into Rust and its ecosystem. The current focus is clearly in the Embedded space as we are working on efficient capture of data and utilizing that data to make better decisions and drive the business value for our end customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation is proud to work with a growing roster of exciting and innovative companies around the world. As we continue to grow, we’re working to shine the spotlight on each of our members and introduce them to the community. To that end, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-chen-239028a/&quot;&gt;Marco Chen&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parastate.io/&quot;&gt;ParaState&lt;/a&gt;, was kind enough to answer some of &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum&quot;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; questions. Here’s what Marco had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rousskov%3A-to-kick-things-off%2C-let%E2%80%99s-start-with-an-overview-of-parastate-and-what-you-do.&quot;&gt;Rousskov: To kick things off, let’s start with an overview of ParaState and what you do. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-01-member-spotlight-parastate/#rousskov%3A-to-kick-things-off%2C-let%E2%80%99s-start-with-an-overview-of-parastate-and-what-you-do.&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chen&lt;/strong&gt;: ParaState is a multi-chain, smart contract platform that bridges the application and developer ecosystem between Polkadot, Substrate and Ethereum, as well as other networks wanting to provide high-performance Ethereum compatibility. Parastate supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) pallet, which provides seamless compatibility with all existing Ethereum applications. It also provides developers with a next-generation smart contract implementation environment, Ewasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ParaState is proud to support more than 20 different programming languages to create Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, which we feel helps unite a larger community of developers to boost cross-chain interoperability. Earlier this year, ParaState officially launched its public testnet, Plato, which is currently running as a standalone Substrate blockchain. Plato is the first production-ready public testnet featuring both EVM and Ewasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rousskov%3A-tell-us-about-parastate%E2%80%99s-use-of-rust.-where-are-you-utilizing-it-and-how-do-you-expect-that-to-evolve%3F&quot;&gt;Rousskov: Tell us about ParaState’s use of Rust. Where are you utilizing it and how do you expect that to evolve? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-01-member-spotlight-parastate/#rousskov%3A-tell-us-about-parastate%E2%80%99s-use-of-rust.-where-are-you-utilizing-it-and-how-do-you-expect-that-to-evolve%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chen&lt;/strong&gt;:  Rust is a very promising programming language in cloud and serverless computing sectors. All the latest new public chain projects like Polkadot, Near and Solana use Rust to write their infrastructure. ParaState aims to bring Rust into Ethereum compatible networks. We are working on launching a Rust software development kit (SDK) to enable developers to build applications with Rust on top of our infrastructure. It will be the first Rust SDK among all Ethereum compatible ecosystems. Right now, Solidity is the top programming language on Ethereum and has roughly 300K developers all over the world, but we expect to attract twice as many Rust developers to build with us in the blockchain industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rousskov%3A-what-was-parastate%E2%80%99s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;Rousskov: What was ParaState’s motivation to join the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-01-member-spotlight-parastate/#rousskov%3A-what-was-parastate%E2%80%99s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chen&lt;/strong&gt;: The Rust Foundation is the official community for Rust developers around the world. As we expand our use of Rust we want to ensure we are a part of this leading organization and have the opportunity to help further the Foundation’s work and the use of Rust worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rousskov%3A-what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-in-the-months-and-years-ahead%3F&quot;&gt;Rousskov: What do you hope the Rust Foundation will accomplish in the months and years ahead? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-10-01-member-spotlight-parastate/#rousskov%3A-what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-in-the-months-and-years-ahead%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chen&lt;/strong&gt;: Above all else, we’re hoping the Rust Foundation will help promote and further the growing Rust developer community all over the world and help shine a spotlight of some of the exciting work being done.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Open Source Security</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-09-21-member-spotlight-open-source-security-software/"/>
		<updated>2021-09-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-09-21-member-spotlight-open-source-security-software/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2021-09-21-member-spotlight-open-source-security-software/member_spotlight_brad_spengler.png&quot; alt=&quot;Brad Spengler Open Source Security&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation has been building some great momentum since our launch earlier this year, and we’re excited to share that our member roster is growing. Over the coming few months, we’ll be doing some deep dives with our new member companies so you can get to know our community a bit better. We’ll share some background on what they do, why they chose to join the Rust Foundation and what they hope to accomplish going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To kick things off, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/spendergrsec&quot;&gt;Brad Spengler&lt;/a&gt;, president at &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensrcsec.com/&quot;&gt;Open Source Security&lt;/a&gt;, answered some of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoelMarcey&quot;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; questions. Here’s what he had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;marcey%3A-for-those-who-don%E2%80%99t-know%2C-tell-us-a-little-about-open-source-security.&quot;&gt;Marcey: For those who don’t know, tell us a little about Open Source Security. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-09-21-member-spotlight-open-source-security-software/#marcey%3A-for-those-who-don%E2%80%99t-know%2C-tell-us-a-little-about-open-source-security.&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spengler&lt;/strong&gt;: Open Source Security, Inc. develops and maintains grsecurity®, a secure drop-in replacement for the Linux kernel.  Our team has created the technologies behind DEP, ASLR, CFI, and many other defensive measures adopted in one form or another by all modern operating systems. We combine our deep expertise with swift and detailed support, acting as a trusted advisor and an extension of our customers&#39; security and kernel engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our primary customer base involves companies with products or services that require a higher level of security assurance for Linux than is typically available elsewhere, with a specific focus on the kernel itself. One obvious example is the web hosting industry, particularly in shared hosting, where one webapp compromise or fraudulent customer grants access to the attack surface of the Linux kernel.  A compromise of the kernel is capable of defeating nearly all other security in place, putting the sensitive information of other customers on the same system at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;marcey%3A-tell-us-about-open-source-security%E2%80%99s-use-of-rust.-how-are-you-using-it-currently-and-how-might-that-evolve%3F&quot;&gt;Marcey: Tell us about Open Source Security’s use of Rust. How are you using it currently and how might that evolve? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-09-21-member-spotlight-open-source-security-software/#marcey%3A-tell-us-about-open-source-security%E2%80%99s-use-of-rust.-how-are-you-using-it-currently-and-how-might-that-evolve%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spengler&lt;/strong&gt;: We are interested in Rust, but are not (yet) using it ourselves in services offered to customers.  That will certainly change given that support for Rust is going to be merged in the upstream Linux kernel, and we believe it will be critical to more widespread adoption.  This is actually what led us to begin supporting (in collaboration with Embecosm) the full-time development of a GCC front-end for Rust last year, which we announced here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensrcsec.com/open_source_security_announces_rust_gcc_funding&quot;&gt;https://opensrcsec.com/open_source_security_announces_rust_gcc_funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work, being headed by Philip Herron with help from two Google Summer of Code students and a surprising number of members of the Rust community, has accomplished an impressive amount in just its first year. We&#39;re so pleased with the progress being made that we&#39;re extending and expanding that support for the upcoming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;marcey%3A-what-was-open-source-security%E2%80%99s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;Marcey: What was Open Source Security’s motivation to join the Rust Foundation? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-09-21-member-spotlight-open-source-security-software/#marcey%3A-what-was-open-source-security%E2%80%99s-motivation-to-join-the-rust-foundation%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spengler&lt;/strong&gt;: When we heard about the formation of the Rust Foundation, we wanted to make sure we were involved to help support the broader goals and initiatives of Rust, rather than just the GCC-specific work we&#39;re funding. We also wanted to demonstrate that there is both interest and funding for a broader Rust ecosystem that we believe will be crucial to its widespread adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;marcey%3A-what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-going-forward%3F&quot;&gt;Marcey: What do you hope the Rust Foundation will accomplish going forward? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-09-21-member-spotlight-open-source-security-software/#marcey%3A-what-do-you-hope-the-rust-foundation-will-accomplish-going-forward%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spengler&lt;/strong&gt;: Long-term, we&#39;d like to see the Rust Foundation help break down barriers to Rust adoption, support the entire Rust ecosystem, and help publicize Rust&#39;s strengths and successes to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;marcey%3A-when-and-how-did-you-personally-get-involved-with-rust-itself-and-how-has-your-involvement-evolved%3F&quot;&gt;Marcey: When and how did you personally get involved with Rust itself and how has your involvement evolved? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-09-21-member-spotlight-open-source-security-software/#marcey%3A-when-and-how-did-you-personally-get-involved-with-rust-itself-and-how-has-your-involvement-evolved%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spengler&lt;/strong&gt;: I&#39;ve followed Rust with interest for some time now.  For the past 20 years of grsecurity development, our strategy has always been closing down entire classes of vulnerabilities and avenues of attack, so a language that can accomplish the same for new code is closely aligned with our vision. While I&#39;ve been critical in the past of mass-rewriting of existing codebases in memory-safe languages as a viable security strategy, I absolutely believe the greatest good can be achieved when the barriers to entry for Rust are broken down and the &amp;quot;mixed-binary&amp;quot; problem mentioned above is resolved. That would provide Rust the equal footing and ease of adoption that will allow it to thrive on its substantial merits. I&#39;m eager to see what&#39;s in store for Rust in the future, and I’m happy to play a tiny part in enabling others to pursue work on Rust that will benefit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Announcing our Executive Search</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-06-25-announcing-executive-search/"/>
		<updated>2021-06-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-06-25-announcing-executive-search/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With a successful launch behind us and an ambitious agenda ahead, the Rust Foundation is looking to channel the energy and vision of our members with the hiring of the organization’s first permanent executive director. In short, we’re in search of a dynamic leader who can help us unlock the Foundation’s full potential, connecting our aspirations with strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there would be clear benefits to having an existing member of the Rust community fill this role, we would also be excited to introduce someone new with the right blend of experience and expertise. In either case, the new executive director will need to work with and learn from Rust’s famously supportive community in order to succeed. This person will lead the Foundation’s efforts to support the volunteer work of maintainers, by identifying, funding, and leading programs like eliminating maintainer out-of-pocket costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a leader who can develop clarity in ambiguous situations and who can experiment and explore the best ways for the organization to fulfill its mission. We’re looking for a collaborator and consensus-builder, someone who is adept at working with stakeholders, engaging volunteers, and empowering people to joyfully do their best work. We’re looking for someone who eats and breathes accountability, who is comfortable assembling a strategy and then taking responsibility for its execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know is interested to learn more about the executive director role, we invite you to review the &lt;a href=&quot;https://candidates.perrettlaver.com/vacancies/2358/executive_director/&quot;&gt;full description&lt;/a&gt;. The Rust Foundation has retained the services of Perrett Laver to lead our search for the ideal candidate. Those wishing to be considered should follow the instructions available within the position description, submitting a CV along with a cover letter that details why their qualifications and talents make them particularly well-suited to fill the role. This is a global search — US residency is not a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation Board of Directors also wishes the best to Ashley Williams, who will be leaving the post of interim executive director after playing a key role in helping us launch the Rust Foundation. We wish Ashley great success as she moves on to her next adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rust Foundation is an Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to gender identity and expression, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, disability, ancestry, marital status, military or veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Introducing Joel Marcey</title>
		<link href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-04-29-introducing-joel-marcey/"/>
		<updated>2021-04-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-04-29-introducing-joel-marcey/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the next five weeks, we&#39;ll be running a series called &amp;quot;Getting to know the board&amp;quot;, publishing blog posts from each member of the Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, introducing them to the community. You can view the posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/getting%20to%20know%20the%20board%20series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since my late father gave me access to his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT&quot;&gt;IBM PC XT&lt;/a&gt; back in the early-md 1980s, and I decided that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fdisk&quot;&gt;FDISK&lt;/a&gt; was the most interesting command in the IBM instruction reference manual, it was pretty clear where my career path was heading, even if my father was not so keen on my use of the command on his computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first programming language I was ever exposed to was BASIC (or maybe it was Logo - anyway, I digress) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;10 PRINT &amp;quot;HELLO&amp;quot;
20 GOTO 10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look familiar? For many of us, these two lines were our first exposure to the power of what programming could do. Look at all those “Hello”s just printing ad nauseum until we stopped it with a Ctrl-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From BASIC, the list of languages I used grew to Pascal in high school to C, C++, Smalltalk and Java in college. I was actually a Java support engineer in the IT department of Intel as part of my first full time job back in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around 2000 where I believe my interest in programming languages went to the next level. Intel, along with Microsoft and HP, was one of the co-sponsors for the standardization of C# and the CLI (a.k.a. CLR) in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecma-international.org/&quot;&gt;Ecma&lt;/a&gt;. And I was Intel’s main representative in that effort. For much of that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelmarcey.com/resume&quot;&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt;, I did my small part to shape what would become those two standards - I wrote documentation tools (XML to Word using XSLT and COM Interop - remember COM Interop?), wrote pieces of both specifications, was convenor of the CLI standard technical group, and chair of the committee responsible for those standards and other programming-based standards as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work in Ecma and the relationships I made there led me to Facebook in 2013 as a contractor where I was hired to help document and release a new programming language called Hack. And I have been at Facebook ever since, now a full-time employee. In that time, I have been involved with even more programming languages - PHP, Hack, JavaScript (where we used it and React to build one of my favorite projects ever, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docusaurus.io/&quot;&gt;Docusaurus&lt;/a&gt;), Flow, and, of course, Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have known about Rust since its early days back in 2010-2011, and, of course, later heard of the “canonical” &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, The Rust Programming Language. But I really hadn’t started getting directly involved with the language until towards the end of 2019 when I began to work with the team responsible for Facebook’s digital wallet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.novi.com/&quot;&gt;Novi&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook, through Novi, is a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://diem.com/&quot;&gt;Diem Association&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/diem/diem&quot;&gt;Diem blockchain&lt;/a&gt; is primarily written in Rust, covering 94 percent of the open source&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/diem/diem&quot;&gt;codebase&lt;/a&gt;. In addition,&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.diem.com/main/docs/move-introduction&quot;&gt;Move&lt;/a&gt;, a new, secure programming language to be used for the blockchain, was developed with Rust. It was with this work , and then seeing how Facebook was really investing in the Rust language throughout the company, that I knew Rust’s rise and popularity wasn’t just fleeting. Rust is here to stay as a language to be used for big things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing always stuck in my mind as I learned and utilized all of these languages -- can they evolve to continue making the lives of developers easier? Some people see a productivity progression from C to C++ to C#, for example. I saw a productivity progression from PHP to Hack. I believe Rust falls into that increased productivity category. Working with the language, how it is able to easily, yet with such precision and detail, let you know where you have gone wrong at compile time, you just feel more efficient. Rust stands on its own merits, but I have to imagine coming from a language like C++ to Rust, is where that productivity progression really shines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, seriously, if the Linux kernel is actually starting to even &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/linus-torvalds-weighs-in-on-rust-language-in-the-linux-kernel/&quot;&gt;consider&lt;/a&gt; Rust as a language to be used for that codebase, well, that’s when you know you have made it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to work with everyone to help drive the language forward. I am really excited to be part of the Rust Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the next five weeks, we&#39;ll be running a series called &amp;quot;Getting to know the board&amp;quot;, publishing blog posts from each member of the Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, introducing them to the community. You can view the posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/getting%20to%20know%20the%20board%20series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m super excited to have the opportunity to join the Rust Foundation board to both continue to support Rust and help to grow its usage at Google. I am currently the Director of Engineering for Android Platform Programming languages, where I work with teams supporting C++, Java, Kotlin, and Rust development. Like many other software projects, improving memory safety in our most performance-sensitive code is a critical need on Android to both keep our users safe and reduce the number of emergency security updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Google, I was at Mozilla. I started there in 2013, working on the new Servo browser engine (back in the days of Rust 0.7, when it was still a managed-memory language that looks very different from today)! It was a delightful experience to get to collaborate with the Rust team as the language evolved, alongside the development of the Servo browser engine and several other projects. Later, my primary activity was the work to make it possible to use Rust code in Firefox and share pieces with the community - which was really more about people, processes, and tooling than the language or libraries! I’m excited to have the opportunity here at Google to continue to ship more software that uses Rust while sharing our feedback and contributing back to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hopeful that the Foundation will help Rust grow new collaborations around activities that many individuals and companies are doing today that could benefit the broader community. For example, each crate import/update undergoes additional security reviews, license/code verification, and performance analysis internally at most companies, but that information is not shared externally today. Further, while it’s ideal to write new projects in Rust, for most of us, we need to integrate Rust into existing systems - many of which are in C++ and each of which uses a unique set of features that pose challenges to efficient integration with Rust. Collaborating across companies, we could build solutions that work across the industry. Finally, for many critical systems (e.g., device drivers), formal verification that is accessible to Rust developers could also help us eliminate an even broader set of issues in software systems beyond memory safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Mozilla, my PhD work was on an ML dialect, Manticore, with my contributions focused on compiler optimizations and the runtime (GC, parallelism, core libraries, etc.). A longer time ago, I spent 7 years at Microsoft on Visual Studio working on the IDE and build systems and managing the team that built the new text editor, debugger, and common compiler infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m from the Chicago area originally, but have spent most of my management career building and working with hybrid teams and partners spread across the globe. I’ve been a “gym rat” since my teenage years, and one thing I’ve enjoyed has been working out at a variety of curious fitness centers globally with other Rustaceans!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the next five weeks, we&#39;ll be running a series called &amp;quot;Getting to know the board&amp;quot;, publishing blog posts from each member of the Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, introducing them to the community. You can view the posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/getting%20to%20know%20the%20board%20series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Josh Stone, and I’m serving on the Rust Foundation board as a Project Director in the area of reliability. When I’m not thinking in Rust, you might find me riding my bike, playing video games with my kids, or learning the next skill in my pandemic-initiated woodworking. But for now I’d like to share just a little bit about how I got started with Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite way to tinker with a new programming language has been to solve &lt;a href=&quot;https://projecteuler.net/&quot;&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt; problems. My day job was all in C and C++, but I would tinker with other languages when I could, and for a while my main preference was Python. In line with the site’s policy, I won’t share all my solutions. However, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projecteuler.net/problem=1&quot;&gt;first problem&lt;/a&gt; has been spoiled many times, asking you to “Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000”, so here’s what I had in Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def solve(U=1000):
    def sum_multiples(n):
        m = (U - 1) // n
        return n * m * (m + 1) // 2
    return sum_multiples(3) + sum_multiples(5) - sum_multiples(15)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust had been on my radar for a while, but I was only reading about it here and there. In April 2014, I finally gave it a real try, and my very first Rust program was just a translation of that problem 1 solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fn solve(u: uint) -&amp;gt; uint {
    let sum_multiples = |n| {
        let m = (u - 1) / n;
        n * m * (m + 1) / 2
    };
    sum_multiples(3) + sum_multiples(5) - sum_multiples(15)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I barely needed to change anything at all, but it gave me a fully compiled and optimized program, which was very exciting to me. In fact, if this is called with constant input, it will even get inlined and optimized down to the final answer, statically. This code still works with modern Rust too, if we fix the pre-1.0 &lt;code&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt; -- just change that to &lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt; or perhaps &lt;code&gt;u32&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That little example doesn’t really even scratch the surface of the power of Rust though. The easy closure is nice, but you could write that with a C++11 lambda too, or even a GCC nested function in C if you’re a little sadistic. This was just a tiny learning exercise, and the exciting promise it carried was that my Rust code would be &lt;strong&gt;safe&lt;/strong&gt;, statically and continuously checked by the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory safety and thread safety, without sacrificing performance and productivity, what a dream! I’m not exactly sure what pushed me over the edge to try it at that time, but I had certainly seen a fair share of nasty bugs in both userspace and the kernel while working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceware.org/systemtap/&quot;&gt;SystemTap&lt;/a&gt;. (Coincidentally, Graydon Hoare also worked on that project, but before my time.) Not all of those bugs I experienced would be caught if written in Rust, but certainly some would. It really does feel like rustc is a big step toward the mythical &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.c2.com/?SufficientlySmartCompiler&quot;&gt;Sufficiently Smart Compiler&lt;/a&gt;, letting you write nice code without worrying about a suite of low-level gotchas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went on porting more of my code to Rust, and when the num crates were pulled out of std before Rust 1.0, I was happy to volunteer as a maintainer, being directly useful to my Project Euler tinkering. As I started applying parallelism to some of those harder problems, I got involved in Rayon, and so on I’ve been happy to contribute to other crates as well. Then 4 years ago I changed teams at Red Hat to start maintaining the Rust toolchain for Fedora and RHEL full time, making Rust &lt;em&gt;officially&lt;/em&gt; “what I work on.” Now with the Foundation, I’m excited to be in a position to enable more people to share in that work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the Rust project, I’m currently a member of the release team, the security response working group, and compiler team contributors with a focus on the LLVM working group. I hope these roles have prepared me well to serve as Project Director for reliability. We always want Rust to “just work”, so you’re free to update to the latest release without fear of regressions. Our track record is good, but of course not perfect, and I’ll be looking for ways to track and improve this. Services like &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;crates.io&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.rs/&quot;&gt;docs.rs&lt;/a&gt; are important too, not just in general uptime but also broad accessibility. I have less experience in this kind of infrastructure, but I am definitely open to suggestions. Let me know how the Rust Foundation can make Rust more reliable for you!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the next five weeks, we&#39;ll be running a series called &amp;quot;Getting to know the board&amp;quot;, publishing blog posts from each member of the Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, introducing them to the community. You can view the posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/getting%20to%20know%20the%20board%20series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, Rustaceans! My name is Shane Miller, and I lead the Rust Platform team at AWS. I have been creating my own unique career path (maxing out my weirdness budget) for about 30 years. I have been a high school dropout, Smalltalk principal engineer, university math faculty, retail business owner, political consultant, engineering manager, and Principal Technical Program Manager and Senior Engineering Manager at AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At AWS, we evaluate everything using our leadership principles, and my favorite principle is, “Leaders are right a lot. [...] They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.” The best thing about working at AWS is the seemingly infinite opportunities to “disconfirm my beliefs”, and my sense is that this principle is a guiding force in the Rust community as well. That’s one of the things that makes me want to contribute to the future success of Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an accidental leader for Rust at AWS. I started down this road in 2019, trying to solve my own problem. I was building a new engineering team that had developed a prototype in Rust, and the only way we could successfully deliver our goals was to both grow our team and our Rust expertise. Some of you have received cold calls or emails from me ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January of 2020, my engineers and I decided to host an internal Rust workshop, so we could meet the AWS Rust community. I reserved a room for 30 people, and we sent out an internal survey to find out how many engineers would be interested in attending. The response was hundreds of engineers wanted to attend and dozens wanted to use the opportunity to give a talk about their own Rust work at AWS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My engineers and I became internal Rust community organizers at AWS. We coordinate a talk series called “A Slice of Rust,” host what amounts to company-wide sprint demos called “A Drink to Rust,” support Rust office hours, build and host Rust workshops, and facilitate Rust engineer recruiting. And all of that has paid off - not just for our team - but for all of Rust at AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did grow our team, by the way, and we started a new one. We created a team focused on Tokio, and more recently, we expanded the team’s charter and hired key Rust maintainers to continue to work in collaboration with the larger Rust community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a director on the Foundation&#39;s Board, I envision the Foundation becoming an organization that provides the Rust project maintainers with the support I provide my own AWS team. We make Rust truly accessible when we eliminate maintainer out-of-pocket costs for compute, storage, and productivity tools. We can also provide access to resources like leadership and communication training that could help Rust maintainers grow themselves and their teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’m excited about with the Foundation is that it gives me a mechanism to contribute to our community in different ways. I have a lot of experience delivering software at massive scale. I was a Principal Technical Program Manager at AWS before I returned to the engineering manager role. I launched services that spanned organizations and geographies. I know how hard it is to be successful with a combination of complexity and scale, and I am looking forward to helping our community simplify some of those complexities. In the words of Seth Godwin, “What do we do for a living? [...] what we do is we try to change everything. [...] we try to find a piece of the status quo - something that bothers us, something that needs to be improved, something that is itching to be changed - and we change it. We try to make big permanent, important change.” Let’s build community and technology that outlast us all.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-04-15-introducing-jane-lusby/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the next five weeks, we&#39;ll be running a series called &amp;quot;Getting to know the board&amp;quot;, publishing blog posts from each member of the Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, introducing them to the community. You can view the posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/getting%20to%20know%20the%20board%20series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! My name is Jane Lusby aka &lt;code&gt;@yaahc&lt;/code&gt;. My pronouns are she/her. You might know me as the maintainer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://rustbeginners.github.io/awesome-rust-mentors/&quot;&gt;awesome-rust-mentors&lt;/a&gt; or as the lead of the error handling project group. Today I&#39;m excited to announce that I&#39;m going to be the new project director of collaboration on the board of The Rust Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some background, the collaboration project director is one of the three area project directors, the other two being Reliability and Quality. The Rust project is emphasising collaboration because we believe that software engineering is primarily a social process rather than a technical one making establishing and nurturing relationships essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, my personal involvement in Rust started back in early 2018 as part of a maker night project at my last job. We decided to make a physical button to launch our &amp;quot;cannon test suite&amp;quot; and picked Rust as the language to build it with. I quickly grew enamoured and started using Rust every chance I got, though initially it mostly ended up being used to rewrite bash scripts but with better error handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I further supplemented my learning by looking for random open source projects I could contribute to in order to learn Rust from experts. I started with clippy and rustfmt, which I found with the help of &lt;a href=&quot;https://this-week-in-rust.org/&quot;&gt;this-week-in-rust&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s CFP section, doing what small contributions I could. I also started going to meetups, which is where I met Manish when he randomly walked up to me, said hi, thanked me for my clippy contributions, and offered to mentor me if I want to contribute more &lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI8Gzg11LBo&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This to me is the moment where I felt like I&#39;d truly joined the rust community. Through Manish&#39;s mentorship I met my first Rust friends. Manish encouraged me to do my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI8Gzg11LBo&quot;&gt;first talk at COGoldRust&lt;/a&gt; and to blog more as a way to practice technical speaking. Thanks to the further contributions Manish encouraged, I ended up joining the clippy team, and later wg-traits as well. I probably wouldn&#39;t be where I am today without Manish&#39;s support and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactions like the one between Manish and I are the kind of collaboration I want to encourage and help grow through the Rust Foundation. I also want to tackle problems that affect active contributors, such as burnout, unconscious bias, and effective moderation tools, to name a few. I don’t have solutions to these problems yet, but I’ll be working together with the team at the foundation and the rest of the Rust community to address them. So please, if you have any feedback, ideas, or problems related to collaboration that you think I should know, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yaahc_/&quot;&gt;please reach out&lt;/a&gt; to me and let me know. Rust has already done a great job building up a healthy community. My hope is to take what I&#39;ve learned through my involvement and from other members in the community and to apply that going forward to make the Rust Foundation as powerful and positive a tool for the rest of the community as it can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: When I&#39;m not writing Rust, I spend most of my time relaxing with my beautiful partner and our three cats. As a hobby I like to experiment with making espresso, though ironically I only ever make decaf for myself because caffeine makes me ill.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the next five weeks, we&#39;ll be running a series called &amp;quot;Getting to know the board&amp;quot;, publishing blog posts from each member of the Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, introducing them to the community. You can view the posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/getting%20to%20know%20the%20board%20series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust Foundation is up and running! This is really a great milestone for the Rust ecosystem. A system programming language like Rust is a fundamental building block so having an independent entity (the foundation) to facilitate open governance will boost widespread adoption for sure. Open governance here means certain assets such as logo, trademark, IT infrastructure and so on are NOT controlled by a single commercial organization, and with the governance structure separating decisions about funds and business affairs from the technical project’s decisions, all these will give participants from various organizations, even they are competitors in business, a neutral place with assurance backed by the foundation bylaw and operation mechanism. I know the foundation also serves other functionalities and those are all benefits to having a foundation, but the open governance part is a very important one I think. Projects like Kubernetes were much more widely adopted and attracted many players since the CNCF was established, and now it is the de-facto standard in the industry. And there are many more you can name. To be honest, the current Rust community governance structure is indeed open and very welcoming already, from the RFC process to the diversity of developers and various gate-keepers, so I really appreciate Mozilla’s great effort and the whole community to make this happen. And the establishment of the Rust foundation will just make it more attractive and give commercial players more peace of mind, and the composition of the founding platinum member companies so far has proven this. I am also happy to see that Rust is truly a global development activity, with contributors (copyright owners) from so many countries across almost all continents, and the software is publicly available across national boundaries. These will continuously be the mission and vision of the Rust Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mainly done C programming in development work and my past technical experience was mainly focused on operating systems, media processing and other embedded system software. So performance and resource consumption are always some of the key metrics to consider. Rust is certainly a kind of language that can match C/C++ here. The second well recognized beauty of Rust is memory safety. Both of these reasons are why the company I am working for, Huawei, is interested in Rust and would like to invest to make the language widely adopted in products, since as an ICT infrastructure vendor, performance and security are basically the two fundamental baselines in many scenarios to judge when choosing a new programming language. But actually when I first got introduced to Rust by friends, I was amazed not by the above two advantages compared to other languages, instead by the look-and-feel of the language, the cleaner syntax, better modularity and more importantly, the package-management system, which certainly C/C++ is lacking as a standard. Although I did not have the chance to switch from C to Rust in my development work then, I can certainly understand why many have done so or make Rust as their first choice of system programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2021-04-08-introducing-peixin-hou/rustchinaconf.png&quot; alt=&quot;scenes from rust china conf 2020&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let me share a bit information on what is happening in where I am from, China. At the end of last year, Rust China Conf 2020 was held in Shenzhen, and Huawei is the only top-level sponsor (happily done by my team ☺). In this event, I was thrilled to see so many cases, products and open source projects written in Rust and many developers are just entering university. Some told me they have been using Rust for several years, which means they started programming in Rust from high school. The topics they shared range from data analysis, operating systems, storage solutions, blockchain, robotics, autonomous vehicle and mobile applications. Also, a student from Tsinghua University, RunJi Wang, wrote an elegant distributed file system called MadFS, which helped a 500-node ARM based cluster to champion the recent IO500 List, with a score of almost 4 times than the second on the list (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://io500.org/&quot;&gt;https://io500.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). All of these demonstrated the strong momentum and the active development community here in China. And I will no doubt see more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2021-04-08-introducing-peixin-hou/io500.png&quot; alt=&quot;io500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking into the future, with the establishment of the Rust foundation and strong investment from the members, we will see more language innovation and engineering implementation at a faster pace. For Huawei, areas we will invest in the community will include projects in numerical computation, robotics, virtualization and more. As the only platinum founding member from China so far, we would also like to promote Rust with all partners, this may include setting up local infrastructure such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://crates.io/&quot;&gt;crates.io&lt;/a&gt; and local CI for better access and usability, translating more documentation into Chinese and holding more events here. Last but not least, we are eager to have more Rust talents to join us, in the EU, North America and China! And if you are in a place other than those above but also interested, no worries, let’s talk about more opportunities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it comes with the nature of an open source project that this is the first proper introduction to myself, even though I have been around Rust for over 7 years. But there’s a time for everything and this is a good chance to work out some aspects properly. But first, some details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust has been my chance to be involved in growing and shaping a programming language from early experimentation days into strong industry adoption. It is work that I am grateful for and that I want to continue on the board of the foundation. During my time on the board, I want to bring my experience and encourage a forward-thinking, implementation-driven approach towards a structure that amplifies the great and successful nature of Rust. I represent this with the view of someone who deeply cares about FOSS culture, global communities and a collaborative together. This includes the view of someone who cares about small and independent businesses. Being on the first board is an honor and a commitment - we prepare the space for all the people that come after us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Rustaceans may know me for community work - either through the community team, as one of the founders of &lt;a href=&quot;http://berline.rs/&quot;&gt;Rust Berlin&lt;/a&gt; (over 150 events, go team!), &lt;a href=&quot;http://rustfest.eu/&quot;&gt;RustFest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://oxidizeconf.com/&quot;&gt;OxidizeConf&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve before that spent over a decade moderating bulletin boards (tech and non-tech related), co-created &lt;a href=&quot;https://eurucamp.org/&quot;&gt;eurucamp&lt;/a&gt;, the Berlin Ruby conference and served on the board &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyberlin.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. I’m one of the co-creators and co-maintainers of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://berlincodeofconduct.org/&quot;&gt;Berlin Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;, a campaign to promote Code of Conducts to meetups. Interestingly, it is now used around the globe by conferences and meetups. For a while, I was in the leadership team of the Ruby web framework &lt;a href=&quot;http://padrinorb.com/&quot;&gt;Padrino&lt;/a&gt;. I ran the most active and long-running Elasticsearch users group, before broadening its scope and calling it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Search-UG-Berlin/&quot;&gt;Search UG Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve always been interested in programming languages and communities, which rather naturally led me to Rust - mainly because the project was easy to access and I could watch an interesting new language grow. In 2015, I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;http://skade.me/blog/2015/extending-my-new-years-resolution.html&quot;&gt;not learn new programming languages&lt;/a&gt; and instead focus deeply on Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a wide variety of interests outside of programming languages and tech: I hold a 1st Dan in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%ABd%C5%8D&quot;&gt;Kyūdō&lt;/a&gt; (japanese traditional archery) and do recreational diving. Music is probably the passion that was before and will outlive my career in tech (though purely as a listener - I learned a number of instruments and ultimately decided that I’d rather be an appreciative consumer). Sometimes, there’s little music references in talks and posts such as this. I’m generally interested in almost anything I haven’t tried out yet and always happy to spend some time with people - the best way to approach me at a conference is to tell me a little bit about a unique thing you do outside of coding. You may see me giving lightning talks for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started coding in Rust in 2013 and my first project was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skade/widmann&quot;&gt;widmann&lt;/a&gt; - a port of the Ruby web framework &lt;a href=&quot;https://sinatrarb.org/&quot;&gt;Sinatra&lt;/a&gt; to Rust. Over the past years, I helped out on a number of projects (such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://async.rs/&quot;&gt;async.rs&lt;/a&gt; project and took over maintenance of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skade/leveldb-sys/&quot;&gt;leveldb binding layer, leveldb-sys.&lt;/a&gt; Since 2015, I teach Rust professionally and co-maintain &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ferrous-systems/teaching-material&quot;&gt;Open Source Training Material&lt;/a&gt;, which my courses are based on. In 2018, I went all in and co-founded &lt;a href=&quot;https://ferrous-systems.com/&quot;&gt;Ferrous Systems&lt;/a&gt;, a company focused on helping the industry adopt Rust by spreading knowledge, practice and also improving Rust itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While being busy with these projects, I usually try to avoid coding outside of work hours. For that reason, it was only natural to me to join the Rust project at a different place and am a member of the Rust Community Team since its inception. I’ve always seen the Community Team as a crucial part of the Rust project and one that makes the great work of many engineers visible and accessible. I consider it a misconception that community work is non-technical: people representing a technical project competently need a wide variety of technical understanding and very broad knowledge to be effective and speak to their peers. In some way, it has always been a motivator for me to extend my technical knowledge and view. I understand community engagement as a &lt;em&gt;mapping process&lt;/em&gt; and sometimes literally draw it as a map. As an example, here’s a map of places where I spoke or organised events (green dots) and places where I often travel to for community engagement (blue lines). The latter may also be places where I just happen to travel to regularly and engage with the community on that occasion. Those maps help me both to understand **my **connections and **my **focus. Another map for example is: communities that I know and where I have connections. I’m regularly surprised how many Rust communities are new to me, even as someone actively searching for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/news/2021-04-08-introducing-florian-gilcher/map.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;map of florian&#39;s rust community&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What drew me into the Rust project and still gives me most joy is its pragmatism: a curious mix of interest in theory with a high desire for application. No implementation without talk, but also no talk without implementation. The project has a good feel for when innovation is needed or an existing standard should be taken and implemented well. I believe Rust&#39;s good image as an innovative project is based on good power-management rather than a desire to innovate everywhere. Rust as an organisation and the people working on it as individuals are incredibly self-confident - capable of saying **no **equally strong as it can commit to something. This applies to all levels, especially also to organisational ones. I still, after 5 years, am still happy about the Rust Projects desire for improving on the existing. The Rust project always put people first, which I think is a key reason for its massive growth. For better or worse, the Rust project was able to scale as big as it is by putting serious thinking into the people&#39;s side and trusting happy people to do good work. The Rust Foundation will be a major tool in taking this ethos to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust is a project open to volunteers and this is what allowed me to join. Voluntarism is a strength that - if well-managed and optional - is also a crucial cornerstone for diversified access and enablement of personal opportunities. Not many fields of endeavour make it so cheap and direct to try out and get in touch with a new technology. It is my desire to build structures in which volunteers can spend their time for their personal benefit on their own terms and have a good experience. Given that the space has grown so massively over the last 10 years, this is a space where solutions often need to be invented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my perspective, the foundation is to become an inherent and close part to the Rust project. As it is good practice in the Rust project, I imagine to apply proven standards where useful to make room for effective innovation. I fundamentally believe that “running a global FOSS project sustainably for all” is a nut that has not been fully cracked. I equally believe that those topics will remain in the focus for the next decade and the Rust Foundation can take leadership in finding solutions there - it’s built on a solid foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the Rust programming language would not exist, the Rust project would still have something to bring to the world” is something Mark Rousskov said during one of the foundation setup meetings - words to live by.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the next five weeks, we&#39;ll be running a series called &amp;quot;Getting to know the board&amp;quot;, publishing blog posts from each member of the Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, introducing them to the community. You can view the posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/getting%20to%20know%20the%20board%20series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings fellow Rustaceans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an honor to serve you as lead editor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://this-week-in-rust.org/&quot;&gt;This Week in Rust&lt;/a&gt;, as a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations&quot;&gt;Async Foundations working group&lt;/a&gt;, and now as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/about/&quot;&gt;Rust Foundation board member&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found success with Rust, and was able to lift others to their own success, through the global Rustacean community and, especially, the actions of Rust’s maintainers. We are a group of people where empathy and personal maturity are as important as (if not more important than) technical excellence. We are a shining example of how an open source community can achieve great advancements - advancements with the potential to affect an entire industry - and still treat each other with dignity, respect, and support. We are not successful in spite of our higher standard of conduct, we are successful because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you knew me as a member of the Rust team at Mozilla. After the August 2020 layoffs, I had the opportunity to join Microsoft as a Principal Software Engineer in the Open Source Programs Office. While it’s no secret Microsoft was at odds with open source in the past, I can assure you from my own personal experience that a true transformation has taken place. Microsoft understands that open source software is critical for its success as a business and for the success of our customers. Moreover, Microsoft also understands that, in order for the projects we depend on to be successful, we must behave as exemplary open source citizens, and engage meaningfully with the open source community. This includes donating money as a sponsor of the Rust Foundation. It also includes dedicating engineering effort to the Rust project to make it not only work better for Microsoft but also for all Rustaceans across the world. Microsoft is excited about the opportunities to engage with and give back to the community, and expects to be working closely with Rust’s maintainers on the compiler, core tooling, documentation, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to joining the Rust Foundation, my primary non-profit experience was as a board director of &lt;a href=&quot;https://operationcode.org/&quot;&gt;Operation Code&lt;/a&gt;. Operation Code is an organization dedicated to teaching software engineering skills to the military community and their families. Through my experience there, I learned that the highest duty of any board member is always to those we serve. Sponsors and donors certainly are vital to a foundation’s success, but addressing their needs must never come at the expense of the community that is the reason for our existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my role as Microsoft’s representative on the Rust Foundation board is to represent the interests of Microsoft to the Rust community, but it is even more important for me to represent and advocate for the interests of the Rust’s maintainers and community to Microsoft. Understanding and balancing these needs and finding common ground will not always be easy, but it is something we Rustaceans do every day through our RFC process. There is so much opportunity for us to learn from each other, to build with each other, to design solutions we never would have considered previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My success as a board member will be measured by the success of Rust’s maintainers and the entire Rustacean community. And I need your help. One of the best ways to help me is to continue commenting on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs&quot;&gt;RFCs&lt;/a&gt;. This helps me understand your needs and how I can best support them both as a board member and as a fellow Rustacean. Additionally, since most Rust meetups are still online, I will be attending as many of them as I can over the next few months. Please don’t hesitate to approach me and introduce yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot wait to see what we build together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, I’m Mark Rousskov (often going by simulacrum online), and I’m excited to serve as one of the project directors representing the Core team! I’ve been around in the Rust project since 2016, and currently lead the release team, and am a member of the core, infrastructure, and compiler contributors teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What excites me about Rust is our strong commitment to solving problems through working together, both with people already around us today, but also always looking to include more people to learn from their experiences. I believe this emphasis on connections is the core reason for Rust&#39;s success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example where this collaboration with other communities has had a memorable experience for me was during work on enabling fine-grained parallelism in the Rust compiler. The way that rustc and cargo manage parallelism today is via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://make.mad-scientist.net/papers/jobserver-implementation/&quot;&gt;make jobserver&lt;/a&gt; protocol. The current stable compiler isn&#39;t parallelized beyond the tail end - code generation - and increasing opportunities for parallelism stressed the jobserver. This led to a performance problem, where all readers on a pipe (used within the jobserver as a semaphore) were being woken when a single byte is written in. This led to a thundering herd of threads attempting to read from the pipe (all but one of which would fail). Normally, the next step would likely be to start trying to identify whether this was a known bug and working to report or fix it. However, we happened to have someone already active in the Linux kernel community - Josh Triplett - around helping us benchmark the results, and he informed us that this bug was already being fixed upstream. He also helped us understand the delay before most of our users could expect to see the change in the kernel on their systems. Growing and establishing these connections enhances everyone’s experience, and I look forward to finding opportunities to foster this growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I&#39;m so excited for the Foundation is it will help us define Rust&#39;s values and goals not just around software or programming language design, but around what I believe to be a more fundamental exploration: developing a model for sustainable, effective open collaboration on a global scale, bridging numerous communities. We already go far beyond ‘just’ a programming language in the project’s scope; I’m excited to see where our exploration goes, and what we can achieve together.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the next five weeks, we&#39;ll be running a series called &amp;quot;Getting to know the board&amp;quot;, publishing blog posts from each member of the Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, introducing them to the community. You can view the posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/getting%20to%20know%20the%20board%20series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, Rust community! My name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://tmandry.gitlab.io/blog/&quot;&gt;Tyler Mandry&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m excited to serve as the project director for quality on the board of the Rust Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey with Rust started about five years ago. I was what you might call a reluctant enthusiast. I love learning new ways of doing things, but I’m also somewhat skeptical of “new tech hype.” At the time, I worked in high-performance computing. Eventually I realized a huge portion of our time was spent chasing down bugs, like segfaults and data races, that were difficult to reproduce and could never have existed in a language like Rust.[1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling the pain on a daily basis that Rust promised to prevent was what finally got me interested. But what got me hooked – and inspired me to contribute – was the thoughtfulness and openness of the project itself. The technical decisions were all made in the open, and it was plain that everyone cared deeply about making Rust the best it could be. No one knew me in the Rust community, but I was able to join a working group and contribute changes right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019 I joined Google to work on the Fuchsia operating system, supporting Rust development, and I began leading the Rust on Fuchsia team in early 2020. I’ve contributed a number of things in my time here like async/await compiler optimizations, mentored work like source-based code coverage, and lead the async foundations working group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else should you know about me? Well, when I’m not in front of a computer I’m often on my bike, most likely listening to a podcast. I just began learning to play piano – ask me how that’s going in six months.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-road-ahead&quot;&gt;The road ahead &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-03-18-introducing-tyler-mandry/#the-road-ahead&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking around, it’s becoming clear that Rust will play a big role in how we write software over the next 5-10 years – or more. Reliability, efficiency, and productivity is a combination that will be in demand for a long time to come. I’m extremely excited to see more and more developers learning Rust every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see the establishment of a Rust foundation as a major step forward in the maturity of the project, not unlike what releasing Rust 1.0 meant for the language itself. Starting a foundation makes the project more sustainable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; unlocks a lot of new possibilities. I think the next two years will involve “unlearning” all the things we thought we couldn’t do, but now can thanks to dedicated funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what can the foundation do to improve quality? I have specific ideas, but I think it’s most important that the project first has an &lt;em&gt;accurate, comprehensive, detailed, and up-to-date&lt;/em&gt; view of how it’s doing. So this year, I’d like to begin by helping Rust contributors &lt;em&gt;fix blind spots&lt;/em&gt; like where there are gaps in documentation and compiler errors, with the ability to measure changes over time. Another thing we don’t monitor is how compiled code actually performs; the compiler team &lt;a href=&quot;https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/help-needed-corpus-for-measuring-runtime-performance-of-generated-code/6794&quot;&gt;has wanted this&lt;/a&gt; for a long time, and the Foundation could help make it happen. Finally, it’d be nice to have more visibility into changes in dependencies, like LLVM and system runtime libraries, and how that could affect our pace of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly ambitious, and I don’t expect it all to happen overnight. But I think the project will benefit greatly from making more informed decisions, and I hope this will allow Rust to continue the impressive trajectory it’s had so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a joy to work on Rust, and I get the sense that we’re all just getting started. I’m looking forward to what the Rust project, including the foundation, will do in 2021 and beyond. I hope you are too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]: That’s not to say that the language we were using at the time &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; the problems, just that it failed to prevent them! [2]: And in a year, but that seems too distant to motivate me today. This is the biggest accountability stunt I’ve pulled by far.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the next five weeks, we&#39;ll be running a series called &amp;quot;Getting to know the board&amp;quot;, publishing blog posts from each member of the Rust Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, introducing them to the community. You can view the posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/getting%20to%20know%20the%20board%20series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&#39;m &lt;a href=&quot;https://bholley.net/about/&quot;&gt;Bobby Holley&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve been a Mozillian since 2008, and currently work in the office of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/leadership/#eric-rescorla&quot;&gt;Firefox CTO&lt;/a&gt; on technical strategy and coordination. Last month I joined the Rust Foundation’s inaugural &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board/&quot;&gt;Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, and today I thought I’d share a bit about why I’m here, what I like about Rust, and why I’m excited for its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://venge.net/graydon/talks/intro-talk-2.pdf&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of Rust in 2010, I&#39;ve had the privilege of watching it grow from a skunkworks side-project into the force of nature it is today. I wasn&#39;t involved much during the early years, but in 2015 I began working with the Servo team to figure out how to bring Rust’s unique capabilities to Firefox. We focused on the CSS engine because it was both performance-critical and extremely complex: in principle we wanted to parallelize it, but in practice couldn’t see a realistic path with C++ concurrency. Rust’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html&quot;&gt;mutability control&lt;/a&gt; and package ecosystem were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=220&amp;amp;v=UN_iIExdB9Q&quot;&gt;exactly what we needed&lt;/a&gt;, and allowed us to ship &lt;a href=&quot;https://bholley.net/blog/2017/stylo.html&quot;&gt;Stylo&lt;/a&gt; with better performance, fewer bugs, and in less time than anyone thought possible. Since then I’ve worked on several other Rust-based initiatives in Firefox such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/the-whole-web-at-maximum-fps-how-webrender-gets-rid-of-jank/&quot;&gt;WebRender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/neqo/&quot;&gt;Neqo&lt;/a&gt;, all of which have continued to deepen my appreciation for both the language and the community around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early (pre-1.0) days, I had the mistaken impression that Rust was just for building browsers at Mozilla. So when I first joined #rust on IRC, I was surprised to find it teeming with smart and friendly people — often with no other connection to Mozilla — working together to use the language and move it forward. It’s clear to me now that this broad coalition was crucial. &lt;a href=&quot;http://venge.net/graydon/talks/intro-talk-2.pdf#page=6&quot;&gt;From the start&lt;/a&gt;, Rust did not aim to distinguish itself with novel technical ideas, but rather sought to bring together a number of well-understood concepts from the research community into something coherent, learnable, and broadly useful. This is hard work that takes a village, particularly the feedback loop around feature design, wide experimentation, and iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some sense, the most important insight behind Rust’s success was not about technology but rather about people. Early on the Rust team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/6ewjt5/question_about_rusts_odd_code_of_conduct/didrult/&quot;&gt;made it a priority&lt;/a&gt; to build a healthy and welcoming community around the project. This attracted talented contributors, helped them collaborate productively, and made it fun to stick around. This resulted in excellent software, which in turn attracted even more talent. This approach seems simple and obvious in retrospect, which is a reaction I frequently have to things that Rust gets right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla incubated Rust to build a better Firefox and contribute to a better Internet, but today it&#39;s clear that Rust has outgrown its roots. In its new home with the Rust Foundation, Rust will have the room to grow into its own success, while continuing to amplify some of the core values that Mozilla shares with the Rust community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety&lt;/strong&gt; in a connected world requires securing the browser, but also securing other client software along with the servers that handle people&#39;s data. Rust’s memory safety properties eliminate entire classes of exploits, and bringing those guarantees to more programs can protect people from harm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empowering&lt;/strong&gt; people to create things themselves involves building tools that are safe, performant, and approachable. Web technologies like HTML and JavaScript have dramatically lowered the barrier to publishing information and interactive experiences, but some disciplines — like high-performance or embedded development — have traditionally required experts-only languages like C. Rust’s type checking, tooling, and documentation offer a much more accessible path for these use-cases, allowing more people to build more things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foundational technologies should be developed in a truly &lt;strong&gt;open&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;collaborative&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;inclusive&lt;/strong&gt; way. Since its inception, the Rust project has set a very high standard for constructive dialog and positive collaboration, and serves as a model for how to build a healthy community around open-source technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla and the Rust project are well-aligned on these values today, and you can expect us to champion them in our engagement with the Rust Foundation going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust exists because of the efforts of countless people working together to make software better, and the Foundation exists to empower and support those people to do their best work. This is an important chapter in Rust&#39;s history, and I&#39;m excited to be a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, on behalf of the Rust Core team, I’m excited to announce the Rust Foundation, a new independent non-profit organization to steward the Rust programming language and ecosystem, with a unique focus on supporting the set of maintainers that govern and develop the project. The Rust Foundation will hold its first board meeting tomorrow, February 9th, at 4pm CT. &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/about/&quot;&gt;The board of directors is composed of 5 directors from our Founding member companies, AWS, Huawei, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla, as well as 5 directors from project leadership, 2 representing the Core Team, as well as 3 project areas: Reliability, Quality, and Collaboration. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marks a huge step in the growth of Rust on several axes; not the least of which, a formal, financial commitment from a set of global industry leading companies, heralding Rust’s arrival as an enterprise production-ready technology. I am personally moved, and motivated, by the sense of responsibility that comes from this commitment. Our founding sponsors’ eager and enthusiastic participation is not only a promise to maintain and sustain Rust as what it is today, but an endorsement of Rust’s values and a dedication to share the responsibility of cultivating the future that Rust aspires to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla, the original home of the Rust project, has transferred all trademark and infrastructure assets, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/&quot;&gt;crates.io package registry&lt;/a&gt;, to the Rust Foundation. We’re filled with gratitude for Mozilla whose thoughtful incubation of the project from its inception as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.mozilla.org/rust/&quot;&gt;research project&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html&quot;&gt;establishing independent governance with the 1.0 release in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, has led us to this moment, as we set out as a fully independent organization. Without their support, we wouldn’t find ourselves in the position we do today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, Rust, the programming language, has been a barrier-breaking technology- deconstructing previously assumed-immovable tradeoffs and binary oppositions. Slogans like “concurrency without data races”, “memory safety without garbage collection”, and ultimately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO1z-7cuRYI&quot;&gt;“hack without fear”&lt;/a&gt;, speak to the perspective-challenging character of Rust’s unique marriage of academic research and industry practicality. But to suggest that Rust’s impact is solely technical would be to miss a majority of the story. As a &lt;a href=&quot;https://brson.github.io/fireflowers/&quot;&gt;flurry of blog posts&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ag_dubs/fire-flowers-and-marios-marketing-rust-996b3fdbe8f3&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/247406.html&quot;&gt;leaders&lt;/a&gt; discussed in 2016: &lt;a href=&quot;https://steveklabnik.com/writing/rust-is-more-than-safety&quot;&gt;Rust’s product is not a programming language or a compiler&lt;/a&gt;. Rust’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefeedbackloop.xyz/safety-is-rusts-fireflower/&quot;&gt;product is the experience of being a Rust developer&lt;/a&gt; and it follows that Rust’s website declares its official slogan: “A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’ve always taken the opportunity to editorialize this with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/www.rust-lang.org/commit/f59adeb7fa645e282b2359cb7e10e331ac00d9c5&quot;&gt;the original version I penned in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and recently reiterated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/IwPRu5FhfIQ?t=2164&quot;&gt;my portion of the RustConf 2020 keynote&lt;/a&gt;: “A language empowering everyone, but especially folks who thought that systems programming wasn’t for them.” One of the most powerful driving forces of the Rust project is the simultaneous belief in the power of systems programming and the commitment to ensuring that such power is wieldable by &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;. The accessibility at the heart of Rust’s message of empowerment has motivated every part of the project, from first class package management and developer toolchain, to the culture of excellent error messages and documentation, to international event organizers and translators, to the code of conduct and moderation team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Rust is so much more than a programming language and a community- Rust also represents a new, radical, way to collaborate on open source projects.  The decision making power within the Rust project is uniquely delegated and distributed; with the core team holding little more privilege than other more specialized teams. Rust counts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/governance&quot;&gt;more than 100 team members&lt;/a&gt; as leaders in the design and maintenance of the project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thanks.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;shepherding nearly 6000 contributors to the rust-lang/rust repo alone since the project’s first release&lt;/a&gt;. Through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs&quot;&gt;Rust’s RFC process&lt;/a&gt;, more than 1000 people have made nearly 500 decisions that represent the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#when-you-need-to-follow-this-process&quot;&gt;critical and strategic product and design decisions for the project&lt;/a&gt;. Guiding principles like &lt;a href=&quot;http://aturon.github.io/tech/2018/05/25/listening-part-1/#the-great-int-debate-and-the-no-new-rationale-rule&quot;&gt;“no new rationale”&lt;/a&gt; ensure that these conversations happen fully in the open, giving operational teeth to the fundamental beliefs of the project: that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2020/12/30/the-more-things-change/#on-pluralism-and-the-rust-organization&quot;&gt;plurality of voices&lt;/a&gt; is better than one; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/JLstJFvdl4s?t=1808&quot;&gt;collaboration is not zero-sum&lt;/a&gt;; that we are stronger, and smarter, as a group than alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust believes that the ability of anyone to participate in the design and development of Rust is a mission critical aspect of building a language and ecosystem that is truly accessible to everyone. And the potential of such a system has bore fruit: It is not a mistake that such a promising technology has emerged from such a progressive conception of collaboration. But such a system comes at a cost; a cost that is too often invisible and thus unaccounted for. For too long, open source as both an industry and a community has done a poor audit of its expenses. Notably, ignoring the price of what I’d controversially argue is the core value proposition of open source software: the freedom to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting several decades ago, open source foundations were established to cultivate the use of open source software in commercial organizations large and small. Today, as we announce the Rust Foundation, we build on the incredible success of their mission: We no longer need to evangelize the use of open source software to the largest and most influential players in our industry; we can assume it. Our challenge is a new one, one that emerges from that accomplishment- we need to support and prepare our maintainers and open governance structures to support what promises to be a period of record breaking growth and adoption. The Rust Foundation seeks to center and stabilize the experiences of the amazing people who are responsible for making Rust what it is today, and to generalize and establish a healthier maintainer experience and ecology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is an incredibly exciting moment for Rust. I wrote my first (still publicly available) lines of Rust nearly 5 years ago and it’s amazing to see how far we have come and the promise of how far we might go. Our founding members represent a 2 year commitment to a more than million dollar yearly budget to develop services, programs, and events that will support the Rust project maintainers in building the best possible Rust, and we’ve only just begun.
