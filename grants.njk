<centre><h2>Mission & Program Design</h2></centre>

<h3>The Rust Foundation's intent with the Community Grants Program is to:</h3>


<ul class="grant">
<p><u>Support the maintainers of Rust.</u>  We know that many people have volunteered significant amounts of their time to help make Rust what it is today. We hope that our funding will go some way in acknowledging their efforts and rewarding their future contributions.</p>
<p><u>Nurture and grow the community of Rust users.</u> Rust Foundation grants exist, in part, to support the diversity and health of the Rust community. By supporting contributors across the world, we hope to create more opportunities for Rust community members of all backgrounds.</p>
<p><u>Enable the further innovation of Rust.</u> By rewarding and supporting Rust community members' innovative ideas, our grants serve as a strategic investment in the long-term growth and advancement of the Rust ecosystem.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Principles</h2>

<h3>The design and implementation of the grants program have been guided by the following standards:</h3>

<ul class="grant">
<p><u>Independence:</u> The Community Grants Program must operate, and be clearly seen to operate, independently of the member organizations of the Foundation and any corporate interests.</p>
<p><u>Fairness:</u> Rust Foundation grants must be awarded fairly, without bias or prejudice, and actively seek to represent the diversity of the global Rust community.</p>
<p><u>Transparency:</u> the grant awarding processes must be clearly described both to the applicants themselves and to the community as a whole.</p>
<p><u>Responsiveness:</u> the Rust Foundation must be receptive and responsive to feedback and criticism about the operation of the Community Grants Program. Such feedback should be used to iterate future grant programs.</p>
<p><u>Lightness of touch:</u> the application processes and monitoring and evaluation processes should not be overly onerous for the applicants and successful grantees.</p>
<p><u>Trust:</u> the Rust Foundation must fundamentally trust that its grantees are committed to Rust and not burden them with officious oversight.</p>
<p><u>Impact:</u> Rust Foundation grants should aim to be as impactful as possible in their support of Rust.</p>
<p><u>Flexibility:</u> the Rust Foundation must be prepared to change its expectations of the outcomes of a grant should the personal circumstances of our grantees change.</p>
</ul>
