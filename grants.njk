<p><center><h2>Guiding Principles</h2></center></p>
<br>
<h3>The design and implementation of the grants program has been guided by the following standards:</h3>

<ul class="grant">
<p><u>Independence:</u> The Community Grants Program must operate, and be clearly seen to operate, independently of the member organizations of the Foundation and any corporate interests.</p>
<p><u>Fairness:</u> Rust Foundation grants must be awarded fairly, without bias or prejudice, and actively seek to represent the diversity of the global Rust community.</p>
<p><u>Transparency:</u> the grant awarding processes must be clearly described both to the applicants themselves and to the community as a whole.</p>
<p><u>Responsiveness:</u> the Rust Foundation must be receptive and responsive to feedback and criticism about the operation of the Community Grants Program. Such feedback should be used to iterate future grant programs.</p>
<p><u>Lightness of touch:</u> the application processes and monitoring and evaluation processes should not be overly onerous for the applicants and successful grantees.</p>
<p><u>Trust:</u> the Rust Foundation must fundamentally trust that its grantees are committed to Rust and not burden them with officious oversight.</p>
<p><u>Impact:</u> Rust Foundation grants should aim to be as impactful as possible in their support of Rust.</p>
<p><u>Flexibility:</u> the Rust Foundation must be prepared to change its expectations of the outcomes of a grant should the personal circumstances of our grantees change.</p>
</ul>
