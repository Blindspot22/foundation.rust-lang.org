[<u>Open Source Summit North America</u>](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/) is the premier event for open source developers, technologists, and community leaders brought to you by the Linux Foundation and coming up on May 10-12, 2023.&nbsp;

A handful of Rust Foundation team members will be in attendance to experience as many talks as we can and connect with the open source community in person. We hope to see you there!

Additionally, we are honored to have three of our team members on the agendas of Open Source Summit and the co-located [<u>OpenSSF Day</u>](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/openssf-day-north-america/)\:

* On Thursday, May 11, Rebecca Rumbul (Rust Foundation Executive Director & CEO) will be presenting a talk with Gracie Gregory (Director of Communications & Marketing) about how the Foundation is mapping out its strategy and priorities over the next several years.&nbsp;
* On Wednesday, May 10, Walter Pearce (Rust Foundation Security Engineer) will be taking part in a live panel discussion hosted by Alpha-Omega Project at OpenSSF Day about securing open source software through direct maintainer engagement. &nbsp;
