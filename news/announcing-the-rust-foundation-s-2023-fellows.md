The Rust Foundation’s [Community Grants Program](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/) supports Rust programming language maintainers, community members, and organizers via financial awards, travel stipends, and training access. Through the Community Grants Program, we aim to reward and support innovative ideas that will benefit the Rust ecosystem for an increasingly global and diverse base of users.

Our [Fellowship award](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/fellowships/) is a category of grant given on an annual basis to active members of the Rust programming language with a history of making meaningful contributions to the Rust Project. During their time in the program, our Fellows receive a monthly stipend of $1,000 USD, funding for further training, and travel to relevant events. Our Fellows receive these benefits for one year and then have the opportunity to apply for further funding.&nbsp;

### Today, the Rust Foundation is thrilled to introduce our 2023 Fellowship cohort! Please join us in welcoming...

## Eric Huss ([<u>@ehuss)</u>](https://github.com/ehuss/)

Eric Huss has been involved with the Rust project since 2017. He was drawn to Rust due to its welcoming community and the attraction of a safe systems language that exposed him to new language concepts and can be very productive to use. Eric is currently the lead of the Cargo team (representing the Devtools team on the Leadership Council), lead of the lang-docs team, and maintains and works on a variety of projects and infrastructure around the Rust project.

The focus of Eric’s Fellowship year will be leading the Cargo team, and continue to assist with maintenance and new development; continuing participation in other teams, such as the Devtools team and as lead of the Language Documentation team; continuing maintenance of other Rust-lang projects, such as Rust-enhanced, mdBook, cargo-bisect-rustc, rustfix, the RFC repo, and triagebot, continuing assisting other Rust-related projects when possible.&nbsp;

## Jynn [<u>(@jyn514)</u>](https://github.com/jyn514)

Jynn is the maintainer of Bootstrap, the rust compiler's build system, and has been involved in various other parts of the project including infrastructure, docs.rs, and rustdoc. Jynn currently works at Redjack as a Senior Rust Engineer.

The focus of Jynn’s Fellowship year will be to continue their work on redesigning bootstrap stages, which should improve compile times and make it much easier to experiment with new language features in the standard library itself (see [<u>this issue</u>](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/619)). They also plan to mentor [<u>@nilstrieb</u>](https://github.com/Nilstrieb) with his work on running a debuginfod server which can correlate runtime compiler panics to symbolized backtraces; this should help members of the compiler team more quickly triage and fix bugs.&nbsp;
