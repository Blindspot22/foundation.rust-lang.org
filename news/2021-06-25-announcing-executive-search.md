With a successful launch behind us and an ambitious agenda ahead, the Rust Foundation is looking to channel the energy and vision of our members with the hiring of the organization’s first permanent executive director. In short, we’re in search of a dynamic leader who can help us unlock the Foundation’s full potential, connecting our aspirations with strategy and execution.

While there would be clear benefits to having an existing member of the Rust community fill this role, we would also be excited to introduce someone new with the right blend of experience and expertise. In either case, the new executive director will need to work with and learn from Rust’s famously supportive community in order to succeed. This person will lead the Foundation’s efforts to support the volunteer work of maintainers, by identifying, funding, and leading programs like eliminating maintainer out-of-pocket costs.

We’re looking for a leader who can develop clarity in ambiguous situations and who can experiment and explore the best ways for the organization to fulfill its mission. We’re looking for a collaborator and consensus-builder, someone who is adept at working with stakeholders, engaging volunteers, and empowering people to joyfully do their best work. We’re looking for someone who eats and breathes accountability, who is comfortable assembling a strategy and then taking responsibility for its execution.

If you or someone you know is interested to learn more about the executive director role, we invite you to review the [full description](https://candidates.perrettlaver.com/vacancies/2358/executive_director/). The Rust Foundation has retained the services of Perrett Laver to lead our search for the ideal candidate. Those wishing to be considered should follow the instructions available within the position description, submitting a CV along with a cover letter that details why their qualifications and talents make them particularly well-suited to fill the role. This is a global search — US residency is not a requirement.

The Rust Foundation Board of Directors also wishes the best to Ashley Williams, who will be leaving the post of interim executive director after playing a key role in helping us launch the Rust Foundation. We wish Ashley great success as she moves on to her next adventure.
