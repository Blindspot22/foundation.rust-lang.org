## What are Rust Foundation Fellowships?

Rust Foundation Fellowships are a particular type of grant (within our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/">Community Grants Program</a>) that provide financial and administrative support and recognition to volunteers who are actively contributing to the Rust community â€” and to those who demonstrate the experience and potential to enhance the community through their contributions.

Our Fellowships span one year and include the following benefits:&nbsp;

* A monthly stipend of $1,000 USD per month for 12 months
* An allowance of up to $2,000 for the Fellowship year to support travel to relevant and useful industry events.
* Up to $2,000 towards training and skills development.

## What happens during a Fellowship year?&nbsp;

The program is designed to financially support individuals to have freedom in directing their own work on the Project over a one-year period, and to provide those individuals with complementary resources such as training, networking and event attendance. Our Fellows are not expected to meet specific milestones, however they will be asked to provide written updates and meet with members of the Rust Foundation staff team for updates periodically.&nbsp;

## What learning opportunities will be available to Rust Foundation Fellows in 2023?

Applicants for our 2023 Fellowship will have the option to select a mentored Fellowship, allowing them to receive expert support from active Rust Project contributors in a specific focus area.&nbsp; Self-directed work benefitting the Rust ecosystem is also an option.&nbsp;

### The mentored Fellowships in 2023 are as follows:

* Security Fellowship
* Crates Fellowship
* Infrastructure Fellowship
* Compiler Fellowship
