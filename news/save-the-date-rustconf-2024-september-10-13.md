The Rust Foundation is excited to share that the next RustConf will be taking place in Montreal, Canada from September 10-13, 2024.&nbsp;

Read on for basic details on the Rust Foundation’s support of the quintessential Rust language community gathering in 2024…

## **About RustConf**

RustConf is an annual gathering of the Rust community with content focused on the Rust language and its global base of maintainers, contributors, organizers, and advocates. The event has taken place since 2016, with Rust Project leaders serving on its program committee. The Rust Foundation has been honored to serve as a sponsor since our inception in 2021. Despite having a global draw, RustConf has historically been hosted in the Western United States – Portland, Oregon between 2016 and 2022 and Albuquerque, New Mexico in 2023.

## **RustConf 2024 – the Rust Foundation’s Role**

Over the past two years, the Rust Foundation has worked hard to establish ourselves as stewards of the Rust programming language and supporters of the Rust community.&nbsp;

Because our role in the past has been limited to Diamond Sponsor, we have not had involvement in planning and managing RustConf – this work was taken on by passionate members of the community as well as an external events management group. Like RustConf’s attendees, the Rust Foundation has been grateful to these volunteers and organizers for stepping up to establish RustConf as an unmissable gathering of the Rust community.&nbsp;

In Q4 of 2023, we determined that the Foundation was in an excellent position to play a larger role in producing, planning, and managing RustConf starting with the 2024 event. We sought approval from our Board of Directors to allocate funds to support this work and then sought the blessing of the Rust Leadership Council. With the backing of both groups, we are excited to evolve from RustConf sponsor to organizer in 2024. In doing so, we will lend our resources and expertise to improve various backstage admin processes without compromising RustConf’s community focus.&nbsp;

Following the tradition of RustConf, the program committee will remain independent with participation from the Rust Project and oversight and facilitation provided by the Rust Foundation. We intend to help however we can to ensure that the RustConf program selection process is more inclusive and transparent than ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Rust Foundation is excited to provide a greater level of support and management to RustConf in 2024.

## **Rust Project Involvement**

Because RustConf is an event intended to serve the Rust language community, Rust Project perspectives are important to us.&nbsp;

In addition to having the leadership council involved in the RustConf program committee, we have opened an RFC to discuss the formation of a Rust Project steering committee for RustConf 2024. To learn more, click [<u>here</u>](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3549).

## **Why Montreal?**&nbsp;

The Rust Foundation is aware that many conversations about the location of RustConf have taken place within the Rust Project and the wider Rust language community. We have learned that holding RustConf exclusively in the Western United States has been a limiting factor for many prospective attendees. Considering the global nature of Rust, we felt it was appropriate to consider a wider range of locations in 2024 and seek cities that not only have inclusive policies and cultures but that are easier to get to for Rust community members across the Atlantic.&nbsp;

We are excited to share that RustConf 2024 will be taking place in Montreal, Canada – a vibrant city in Quebec that is well positioned in eastern North America. Montreal is also a relatively affordable city to host events in, which allows us to do more with our budget. We look forward to sharing more details about the venue and location in the coming weeks.&nbsp;
