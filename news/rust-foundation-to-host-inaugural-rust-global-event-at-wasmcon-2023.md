The Rust Foundation is pleased to present [Rust Global](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/rust-global/) – a new event with the first instance taking place within <a target="_blank" href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wasmcon/">WasmCon</a> on September 6, 2023.&nbsp;

The first Rust Global will be a half-day gathering featuring a mix of talks (via the [<u>WasmCon CFP</u>](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wasmcon/program/cfp/#suggested-topics)) and networking opportunities. Content will focus on the intersection of Rust and WebAssembly, Rust case studies for business innovation, and valuable Rust adoption stories.&nbsp;

The Rust Foundation believes that a strong relationship between global leaders and the Rust community is essential as we look toward the future of cybersecurity, business, sustainability, collaboration, and technological innovation where Rust will lend tremendous value. We are excited to help drive collaboration, innovation, and enterprise in Rust through Rust Global at WasmCon 2023.&nbsp;

This event will be the first of many independent and co-located Rust Foundation events around the world to provide opportunities for Rust adopters, advocates, and enthusiasts to learn, share, and network.&nbsp;

We hope to see you at [<u>Rust Global</u>](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/rust-global/) and [<u>WasmCon</u>](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wasmcon/) on September 6, 2023!&nbsp;
