Thank you to everyone who responded to our survey about the Community Grants Program. We are very grateful that you took the time to provide us with your thoughts and ideas. We are now busy working on the final details of the Program in order to open for applications next month, and we wanted to share the results of the survey with you to demonstrate how your input has influenced our thinking.

## Background

In January 2022 the Rust Foundation opened a survey with the objective of gathering the views of the Rust maintainer community about the issues that concerned them and the areas that they felt were most in need of financial support. The aim of this exercise is to help inform the Community Grants Program and to ensure that, as far as is possible within our operational constraints, the funding streams that we launch will go some way to meeting the needs of the community.

## Who Responded

In total 122 completed responses to the survey were received, breaking down by language as follows:

- English: **102**
- Chinese (including simplified): **4**
- Russian: **8**
- German: **3**
- French: **6**
- Portuguese: **1**

The high proportion of responses to the English language version of the survey somewhat belies the geographic diversity of those who responded.  Of those 102 only 44 came from the USA/UK, the remainder were spread across 27 different countries.

In terms of the level of engagement with the Rust Project, a third of respondents described themselves as active contributors. It is interesting to note, however, that breaking out the results into those who completed the English version of the survey, and those who completed the non-English version reveals significant differences, with fewer than one in seven in the latter group considering themselves to be active contributors.  

This trend was continued with memberships of Rust teams, with markedly higher levels of engagement from those who responded in English compared to those who did not.  This is perhaps unsurprising, given that English is the default technical language of these teams. What is significant is that almost two thirds of the non-English respondents expressed a desire to be a member of a team, project group, or working group.
