Today, Google [announced](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2024/02/mentor-organizations-announced-for-google-summer-of-code-2024.html)&nbsp;the 195 open source projects that have been selected for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024. The Rust Project was selected to be part of a group of 30 new organizations participating in the program for the first time.&nbsp;

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a program dedicated to bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors. GSoC 2024 is the 20th edition of the program and all of us at the Foundation are excited that Rust was selected as a participating project this year!

As the legal entity behind the Rust programming language, the Rust Foundation collaborated with leaders within the Rust Project to submit an application for Google Summer of Code this year. While we are named as the mentoring organization, we will be in close coordination with representatives from the Rust Project to carry out this work. The Project has already dedicated considerable time to ensuring GSoC contributors paired to Rust will have an excellent experience. Learn more in [this post](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/02/21/Rust-participates-in-GSoC-2024.html) on the official Rust Programming Language blog and find the Rust Project's GSoC repo on GitHub [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/google-summer-of-code).&nbsp;

The health of open source depends on passionate and curious new contributors entering the ecosystem and being championed throughout the process. Programs like GSoC go a long way towards providing this type of critical contributor support. We look forward to assisting the Rust Project in welcoming and mentoring GSoC participants this year.

*Thank you to the members of the Rust Project who advocated for our application to Google Summer of Code 2024!*
