(Headshot of Tobias appears in a zig-zag, circular frame to the right with the caption &quot;Tobias Bieniek, Rust Foundation Software Engineer.&quot;" title="Tobias Bieniek" /></p><p>The Rust Foundation is pleased to announce the arrival of our newest addition to the team — Software Engineer, Tobias Bieniek. As a member of the Rust Foundation's growing technology team led by Director of Technology, Joel Marcey, Tobias will be focused specifically on serving the Rust programming language's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://crates.io/">Crates</a>&nbsp;Team within the Rust Project.</p><p>Tobias considers himself generalist software developer who has worked at a variety of companies and open source projects including New Relic, Sourcegraph, and PHP in the course of his 20-year career. Originally from Western Australia, he has lived in Vancouver, Canada for the past 10 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Tobias has been involved with the Rust ecosystem since roughly 2015. He started out by contributing to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/">intellij-rust project</a> and the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://crates.io/">crates.io</a>&nbsp;project, initially because the frontend is written in Ember — a framework he is familiar with. For the past several years, he has been contributing to the backend part of the Rust codebase.</p><p>In 2019, Tobias officially joined the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://crates.io/">crates.io</a>&nbsp;team and was asked to co-lead the team in May 2021. In mid-2022, Tobias applied for the first round of fellowship grants of the Rust Foundation (part of our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/">Community Grants Program</a>) and has been in close contact with the Rust Foundation ever since being accepted as a grantee.</p><p>When the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>-focused software engineering role opened up at the Rust Foundation, it felt like a natural fit for Tobias who cited being a fan of open source software development and the Rust ecosystem as his primary reason to pursue the position.&nbsp;</p><p>Please join us in welcoming Tobias to the Rust Foundation team!</p><hr /><p><em>If you would like to find Tobias online, you can connect with him on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/Turbo87">GitHub</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hachyderm.io/@tb">Hachyderm</a>.</em></p></div>
