<h2 id="details">Details <a class="direct-link" href="#details">#</a></h2>
<p>Project grants are financial awards that support specific packages of work that benefit the Rust ecosystem. Grant awards will be in the range of $1,000 to $20,000 and the work should be carried out within six months of the award being made.</p>
<p>Grants are available to individuals, teams of individuals, and organizations (both for-profit and not-for-profit). 50% of the grant award value will be paid at the start of the project, and 50% at a mutually agreed mid-point. Prior to the second payment being made, the people working on the project will have a review call with the staff of the Rust Foundation. We may also ask an external advisor to join this call to enable us to assess the progress made to date.</p>
<p>There will be two rounds of Rust Project Grants. Applications for the first round will open in April 2022, and it is planned that applications for the second round will open in October 2022. A budget of $175,000 has been allocated to each of these funding rounds.</p>
<h3 id="what-work-is-suitable-for-a-rust-project-grant%3F">What work is suitable for a Rust Project Grant? <a class="direct-link" href="#what-work-is-suitable-for-a-rust-project-grant%3F">#</a></h3>
<p>Any work that benefits the Rust ecosystem as a whole is eligible for a Project Grant. Priority will be given to those grants that will clearly deliver a significant benefit to a reasonable proportion of the Rust community. Applicants will choose from one of three categories of project focus: Maintenance and Support; Development and Infrastructure; and Community. The areas of work under each category are:</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance and Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Code review</li>
<li>Documentation updates</li>
<li>Design review</li>
<li>Issue triage</li>
<li>Issue reporting</li>
<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Development and Infrastructure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New features and documentation</li>
<li>Performance enhancements</li>
<li>Rollups/CI/releases</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moderation</li>
<li>Communication (e.g. writing blog posts, release notes, preparing for meetings or taking minutes)</li>
<li>Producing education materials</li>
<li>Providing educational support</li>
<li>Supporting/mentoring/guiding other contributors</li>
<li>Organizing Events / Meetups</li>

<p>All grantees will be required to adhere to the <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Rust Foundation’s Code of Conduct</a>, which is an extension of the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct">Rust Project Code of Conduct</a>. Failure to adhere to the Code of Conduct may result in the grant being terminated.</p>
<h3 id="who-can-apply%3F">Who can apply? <a class="direct-link" href="#who-can-apply%3F">#</a></h3>
<p>Individuals, teams of individuals, and organizations (both for-profit and not-for-profit) are eligible to apply for a Rust Project Grant. Rust Foundation staff, officers, and directors are not eligible to apply for any Rust Foundation grants.</p>
<p>Organizations that are Members of the Rust Foundation are not eligible to apply for Project Grants. Employees of those organizations who wish to apply as individuals or as part of a team of individuals should contact us at <a href="mailto:grants@rustfoundation.org">grants@rustfoundation.org</a> prior to completing an application, in order for us to assess whether a grant award to them might represent a conflict of interest for the Foundation.</p>
<p>All Project Grant applicants must ensure that they are able to receive financial transfers from the USA. Details can be found <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information">here</a> of the restrictions to such transactions.</p>

<p>To help you better understand if a Project Grant might be suitable for you and to help you prepare for the application, the questions asked on the application, and the context for them, are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="individual%2Fteam-applications">Individual/Team Applications <a class="direct-link" href="#individual%2Fteam-applications">#</a></h3>
<h4 id="name(s)%2C-pronoun(s)%2C-email-address(es)">Name(s), pronoun(s), email address(es) <a class="direct-link" href="#name(s)%2C-pronoun(s)%2C-email-address(es)">#</a></h4>
<p>Essential information for us to stay in touch with you.</p>
<h4 id="please-provide-a-link-to-your-github-account(s)">Please provide a link to your GitHub account(s) <a class="direct-link" href="#please-provide-a-link-to-your-github-account(s)">#</a></h4>
<p>This will enable us to better understand your technical expertise and experience, and contributions to Rust.</p>
<h4 id="please-provide-links-to-your-personal-website%2Fpublic-social-media-handles%2Flinkedin-(as-appropriate)">Please provide links to your personal website/public social media handles/LinkedIn (as appropriate) <a class="direct-link" href="#please-provide-links-to-your-personal-website%2Fpublic-social-media-handles%2Flinkedin-(as-appropriate)">#</a></h4>
<p>This will enable us to learn a little bit more about you/your team and any public postings you may have made relating to Rust. We understand that some people choose not to have publicly available social media profiles (or social media accounts at all) nor other public sites. If this is true for you, don’t worry, it won’t count against you in the assessment process.</p>
<h4 id="location(s)-and-language(s)-spoken">Location(s) and language(s) spoken <a class="direct-link" href="#location(s)-and-language(s)-spoken">#</a></h4>
<p>We are keen to reflect the global diversity of the Rust community in our grant awards and this information will help us achieve that.</p>
<h4 id="are-you-%2F-are-any-members-of-the-team-part-of-a-group-that-is-affected-by-systemic-bias%2C-particularly-in-technology%3F">Are you / Are any members of the team part of a group that is affected by systemic bias, particularly in technology? <a class="direct-link" href="#are-you-%2F-are-any-members-of-the-team-part-of-a-group-that-is-affected-by-systemic-bias%2C-particularly-in-technology%3F">#</a></h4>
<p>We are keen for our grants program, at the very least, to not increase systemic bias, and hopefully go some way to reducing it. We will not ask you for details of how you are affected by systemic bias (if you are), we will take your response on trust.</p>
<h4 id="are-you-%2F-are-any-of-the-team-members-currently-paid-(either-by-an-organization%2C-or-through-personal-sponsorship)-to-work-on-the-rust-project%3F-if-so-can-you-please-provide-details">Are you / Are any of the team members currently paid (either by an organization, or through personal sponsorship) to work on the Rust Project?

<p>We are keen to ensure that our financial support goes to those members of the community who are most in need of it. For that reason we won’t make an award to someone who is already paid on a full time basis to work on the Rust Project. People who are only paid on a part-time basis to work on the Rust Project or who currently receive no financial support to do so can apply.</p>
<h4 id="please-give-us-a-little-bit-of-background-about-yourself-and-your-experience-with-rust">Please give us a little bit of background about yourself and your experience with Rust <a class="direct-link" href="#please-give-us-a-little-bit-of-background-about-yourself-and-your-experience-with-rust">#</a></h4>
<p>As indicated in the full question, we're looking for things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long you have been involved with Rust</li>
<li>Details of any teams/working groups you may be a member of (where applicable)</li>
<li>Links to example pull requests you have submitted (where applicable)</li>

<p>Applicants should be confident that they are able to deliver their project without the support of the Foundation, and without over-burdening other maintainers. We understand that they may rely upon the support of others to complete the project, and if this is the case, we would like to know what support is needed and where it will come from.</p>
