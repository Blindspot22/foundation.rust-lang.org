    <h2 id="about-rust-foundation-project-grants">About Rust Foundation Project Grants <a class="direct-link" href="#about-rust-foundation-project-grants">#</a></h2>
<p>The Rust Foundation Project Grants program exists to support specific packages of work that benefit Rust. Project Grants will be awarded to both individuals and teams, whether you're a member of a Rust Project Team or Working Group or not. Additionally, Project Grants are available for non-coding education/outreach work.</p>
<p>Any work that benefits the Rust Project is eligible for a Project Grant. Priority will be given to those grants that will clearly deliver a significant benefit to a reasonable proportion of the Rust community. Ideally, the work will be carried out within six months of the grant being given.</p>

<li>
<p><em>Rust Foundation staff, officers, and directors are not eligible to apply for any Rust Foundation grants.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Employees of organizations that are members of the Rust Foundation who wish to apply as individuals or as part of a team should email us at <a href="mailto:grants@rustfoundation.org">grants@rustfoundation.org</a> prior to completing an application, in order for us to assess whether a grant award might represent a conflict of interest for the Foundation.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>*The Rust Foundation is required to adhere to laws of the United States, and as a result all Project Grant applicants must be able to receive financial transfers from the USA.
