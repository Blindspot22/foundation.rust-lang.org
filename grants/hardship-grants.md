## Program Details

We understand that members of the Rust community may suffer from financial hardship from time to time, which can lead to food and accommodation insecurity. The Hardship Grants programme is aimed at providing short-term financial support to those active maintainers of the Rust Project most in need of help.

* Applicants will be able to apply for amounts of between $500 and $1,500 USD.
* Hardship Grants are available to individuals who contribute significantly to the Rust Project and who have urgent financial insecurity.
* Out of respect for recipients, we will keep all details of Hardship Grant awards private. 

If you would like to apply for a Hardship Grant then please email [grants@rustfoundation.org](mailto:grants@rustfoundation.org) with the subject line “Hardship Grant Application” telling us about yourself and your situation, including details of your contributions to the Rust Project.

Please also review our [general eligibility and exclusion criteria](/grants-eligibility/) before applying.

### Who is eligible to apply for a Hardship Grant?

Rust community members who contribute significantly to the Rust Project and who have urgent financial insecurity.

### I am 17, can I apply for a Hardship Grant?

You have to be 18 or older. We need to be mindful of different countries’ child labor laws, and laws that mean people under the age of 18 can’t enter into legal contracts.

You can apply for up to two Hardship Grants in each calendar year.

## Selection Process

Hardship Grant applications will be reviewed and selected by the Rust Foundation staff team with possible input from Rust Foundation Directors or members of the Project Teams if counsel is needed. As a rule, the Rust Foundation will endeavor to keep details of any Hardship Grant application as private as possible, due to the sensitive circumstances under which someone might apply for a Hardship Grant. 

The decisions will be made based upon:

* The contributions made by the individual to the Rust Project
* The individual’s financial circumstances and need

We will aim to make a decision regarding a Hardship Grant within 5 working days of receiving an application.
