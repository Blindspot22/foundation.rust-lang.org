<p>Rust Event Support Grants are available to provide financial support for individuals, groups, and organizations to help cover the costs they incur in running events that support the Rust community.  A budget of $15,000 USD per quarter has been allocated for Event Support Grants by the Rust Foundation.</p>
<p>Applications for Event Support Grants can be made at any time, though in exceptional circumstances we may suspend applications if our budget for the quarter has already been spent.</p>
<p>Applications can be made for grants from $100 to $500 USD. The types of expenses it is anticipated that the grants will be used to cover include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The renting of event/meeting space</li>
<li>Travel costs</li>
<li>Refreshments</li>
<li>Swag</li>
<li>Online event platform costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Event Support Grant applications will be reviewed and selected by the Rust Foundation staff team.</p>
<p>We will aim to make a decision regarding an Event Support Grant within 10 working days of receiving an application.</p>
<p>All Event Support Grant applicants must ensure that they are able to receive financial transfers from the USA.  Details can be found <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information">here</a> of the restrictions to such transactions.</p>

<h3 id="application-questions-and-context">Application questions and context <a class="direct-link" href="#application-questions-and-context">#</a></h3>
<p>To help you better understand if a Rust Event Support Grant might be suitable for you and to help you prepare for the application, the questions asked on the application, and the context for them, are as follows:</p>
<h4 id="name%2C-pronouns%2C-email-address-of-applicant%3B-name-of-group%2Forganization-arranging-the-event-(if-applicable)">Name, pronouns, email address of applicant; name of group/organization arranging the event (if applicable) <a class="direct-link" href="#name%2C-pronouns%2C-email-address-of-applicant%3B-name-of-group%2Forganization-arranging-the-event-(if-applicable)">#</a></h4>
<p>Essential information for us to stay in touch with you.</p>
<h4 id="links-to-personal-website%2Fpublic-social-media-handles%2Flinkedin-of-applicant%2Forganization-(as-appropriate)">Links to personal website/public social media handles/LinkedIn of applicant/organization (as appropriate) <a class="direct-link" href="#links-to-personal-website%2Fpublic-social-media-handles%2Flinkedin-of-applicant%2Forganization-(as-appropriate)">#</a></h4>
<p>This will enable us to learn a little bit more about you/your team and any public postings you may have made relating to Rust.  We understand that some people choose not to have publicly available social media profiles (or social media accounts at all) nor other public sites.  If this is true for you, don’t worry, it won’t count against you in the assessment process.</p>
<h4 id="about-the-event%3A-location(s)-and-languages">About the event: location(s) and languages <a class="direct-link" href="#about-the-event%3A-location(s)-and-languages">#</a></h4>
<p>We are keen to reflect the global diversity of the Rust community in our grant awards, and this information will help us achieve that. We can support events that are online-only.</p>
<h4 id="please-give-us-a-little-bit-of-background-about-yourself%2Fyour-group-and-your-experience-of-running-rust-related-events">Please give us a little bit of background about yourself/your group and your experience of running Rust-related events <a class="direct-link" href="#please-give-us-a-little-bit-of-background-about-yourself%2Fyour-group-and-your-experience-of-running-rust-related-events">#</a></h4>
<p>If this is your first time running a Rust-related event you can still apply. If you have no experience of running Rust-related events, but have experience of running other events, please include this here.</p>

<p>We are keen for all of the events supported by the Rust Foundation to be as open and inclusive as possible.  We would hope that all live events will be taking place in venues that are accessible to people with disabilities, and that your event will have a code of conduct.</p>
