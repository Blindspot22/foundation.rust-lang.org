These grants reward individuals who have helped make Rust what it is today and are key to its future success.

Grantees in this category are selected for their Rust experience and potential to enhance the community. Benefits include a monthly stipend during the fellowship year, funding for career development, and access to mentorship opportunities.

## Program Details

* Rust Foundation Fellowships support current maintainers of the Rust Project and skilled Rust users with the potential to positively impact the Rust language community.

* Applicants in 2023 will have the opportunity to either select a self-directed or a mentored role for their Fellowship year.

* Fellowships are intended to support work the RFF is already carrying out. Our goal is to help improve RFFs’ work-life balance and reduce burnout, not add to their plate.

* Mentored roles pair RFFs with an expert in the Rust community to help develop their skills and experience in a chosen focus area

* Fellowships do not come with special privileges within the Rust Project - RFFs will not automatically become members of Project Teams or Working Groups.

* RFFs *will not* be required to set and meet specific milestones.

* Each quarter, RFFs will be asked to 1. share a brief, written update with the Rust Foundation team and 2. participate in a check-in call.

* At the end of the Fellowship year RFFs will be asked to write a blog post detailing their experiences and achievements in the program for possible publication on the Foundation’s website.

* All RFFs will be required to adhere to the Rust Foundation’s [Code of Conduct](/policies/code-of-conduct), which is an extension of the Rust Project Code of Conduct. Failure to adhere to the Code of Conduct may result in the Fellowship being terminated.

## Mentored Fellowship Details:

### Security Fellowship

The Security Fellow will have the opportunity to research and implement detection measures in Ecosystem Scanning, including identifying malicious code that can occur in crates, provenance detection, and code health scans (e.g. miri, audit). The Security Fellow will also have the opportunity to contribute to the Penetration Test of the Rust Project, which may involve assessing the security of various components, from the Project in general to specific projects or infrastructure components. This work could encompass penetration testing of systems and conducting code reviews for critical components like CI/CD, bors, rustwide, playground, and more.

*The Security Fellow will receive mentorship from [Walter Pearce](https://github.com/walterhpearce), Security Engineer at the Rust Foundation.*

### Crates Fellowship

The Crates Fellow will have the opportunity to develop a comprehensive understanding of crates.io and focus on enhancing its search experience. The Crates Fellow’s objective will be to explore possibilities, such as incorporating additional metrics for crates and leveraging them to prioritize search results. By working on these enhancements, the Crates Fellow will contribute to optimizing the search functionality on crates.io, thus improving the overall user experience.

*The Crates Fellow will receive mentorship from [Tobias Bieniek](https://github.com/turbo87/), Software Engineer at the Rust Foundation.*

### Infrastructure Fellowship

The Infrastructure Fellow will be responsible for developing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying infrastructure supporting the Rust language. Specific tasks include updating the infrastructure monitoring setup and optimizing the CI (Continuous Integration) process for rust-lang to enhance its efficiency. By actively working on these aspects, the Infrastructure Fellow will play a vital role in ensuring a robust infrastructure and streamlined development workflow for the Rust language.

*The Infrastructure Fellow will receive mentorship from [Jan David Nose](https://github.com/jdno), Infrastructure Engineer at the Rust Foundation.*

### Compiler Fellowship

The Compiler Fellow will develop a comprehensive understanding of the Rust compiler and develop the skills and experience needed to become an active contributor to the compiler work.

*The Compiler Fellow will receive mentorship from TBC FIXME*

### How much time will I have to spend working on Rust for my Fellowship?

### I can’t commit to dedicating 20 hours of time to Rust every month, is that going to be a problem?

While we expect Fellows to spend an average of 20 hours per month on the program, we understand that schedules vary over the course of a year and the program will accommodate this reality as needed.

### If I become a Fellow do I have to increase the number of hours I spend working on Rust?

No. If you are already spending 20 or more hours a month working on the Rust project, then no additional hours will be necessary. We encourage Fellows to limit the additional amount of time they spend working on the project to help achieve a healthy work-life balance.

### I am interested in building the Rust community, not writing code, can I apply?

Yes, although you will be required to have some experience contributing to the Rust community and be able to communicate a clear idea of how your work would benefit the Rust ecosystem.

### I am currently paid to work on the Rust Project, can I apply?

We consider applications from part-time Rust Project contributors or unpaid contributors only.

Spoken English is not a requirement of the program, but Fellows will need a reasonable understanding of written English in order to be able to interact with members of the Project Teams and Working Groups.

### How does the travel stipend work?

Fellows will be asked to inform the Rust Foundation of the Rust-focused event they want to attend during their Fellowship year.

The travel budget (limited to $2,000 USD per Fellow) is intended to provide economy travel, accommodation and subsistence, plus the cost of event admission.

### How does the training stipend work?

The Rust Foundation team will work with each Fellow to understand the type of training support that would be valuable to them. We require training to be relevant to the Fellowship position. Examples of training categories we support: project planning, organizational management, leadership, document writing, and effective communication.

### How will I report my work as a RFF?

Fellows will be required to write a brief report each quarter, and participate in a catch-up call with a member of the Rust Foundation staff team. At the end of the Fellowship year, RFFs will write a brief blog post about their experience for publication on the Rust Foundation website.

### If I become a Fellow, will any information about me be published publicly?

We will publish a brief biography of you on the Rust Foundation website, along with any public social media/other relevant links that you are willing to share. If you would rather we use your online alias in place of your legal name, please let us know. While our preference is to publish a picture of you, we will also accept an avatar as an alternative.

RFFs are typically paid via direct bank transfers.
