<div class="detail3"><p>* Fellowships are intended to support work RFFs are already carrying out. They are not intended to add more work to RFFs' plates.</p></div>

<div class="detail4"><p>* Mentored roles pair RFFs with an expert in the Rust community to help develop their skills and experience in a chosen focus area.</p></div>

<div class="detail5"><p>* Fellowships do not come with special Rust Project privilege - RFFs will not automatically become members of Project Teams or Working Groups.</p></div>

<div class="detail6"><p>* RFFs <i>will not</i> be required to set and meet specific milestones. At the end of the program, RFFs <i>will</i> be asked to write a blog detailing their experience for possible publication on our website</p></div>

<div class="detail7"><p>* Each quarter, RFFs will be asked to share a brief, written update with the Rust Foundation team and participate in a check-in call.</p></div>

<div class="detail8"><p>* All RFFs will be required to adhere to the Rust Foundation’s <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>"https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/", which is an extension of the Rust Project Code of Conduct. Failure to adhere to the Code of Conduct may result in the Fellowship being terminated.</p></div>

<div class="type1"><center><h3>Security Fellowship</h3></center><p>The Security Fellow will have the opportunity to research and implement detection measures in Ecosystem Scanning, including identifying malicious code that can occur in crates, provenance detection, and code health scans (e.g. miri, audit). The Security Fellow will also have the opportunity to contribute to the Penetration Test of the Rust Project, which may involve assessing the security of various components, from the Project in general to specific projects or infrastructure components. This work could encompass penetration testing of systems and conducting code reviews for critical components like CI/CD, bors, rustwide, playground, and more.</p><p>The Security Fellow will receive mentorship from <a href="https://github.com/walterhpearce">Walter Pearce</a>, Security Engineer at the Rust Foundation.</p></div>

<div class="type2"><center><h3>Crates.io Fellowship</h3></center><p>The crates.io Fellow will have the opportunity to develop a comprehensive understanding of crates.io and focus on enhancing its search experience. The crates.io Fellow’s objective will be to explore possible improvements to the crate search experience, such as incorporating additional metrics for crates and leveraging them to prioritize search results. By working on these enhancements, the crates.io Fellow will contribute to optimizing the search functionality on crates.io, thus improving the overall user experience.</p><p>The crates<span>.</span>io Fellow will receive mentorship from <a href="https://github.com/turbo87/">Tobias Bieniek</a>, Software Engineer at the Rust Foundation.</p></div>
