## Program Details

> ### Through the Fellowship program, we hope to provide support to volunteers who are already contributing to the community, and enable those with Rust experience to develop their ability to contribute to the community.

* Rust Foundation Fellowships support current maintainers of the Rust Project and skilled Rust users with the potential to benefit the Rust language community through their contributions. These grants reward individuals whose voluntary work has helped make Rust what it is today, and who are key to its future success.

* The program is designed to financially support individuals to have freedom in directing their own work on the Project over a one-year period, and to provide those individuals with complementary resources such as training, networking and event attendance. 

* Applicants in 2023 will have the opportunity to either choose what they want to focus on during their fellowship year, or focus on specific parts of the Rust ecosystem with help from a dedicated mentor. These mentors will help selected Fellows develop their skills and experience in the chosen focus area over the course of the Fellowship year.

* The Rust Foundation does not expect RFFs to spend 20 more hours a month supporting the community, but rather to reward them for the time they are already contributing to help improve their work-life balance and reduce the risk of burnout.

* Fellowships do not come with special priviledges within the Rust Project - those who are not already will not automatically become members of Project Teams or Working Groups. Prospective Fellows must be able to accomplish their proposed work when applying for it.

## Mentored Fellowship Details:

### Security Fellowship

This role will involve researching and implementing detection measures in Ecosystem Scanning, including identifying malicious code that can occur in crates, provenance detection, and code health scans (e.g. miri, audit).  Furthermore, the Security Fellow will have the opportunity to contribute to the Penetration Test of the Rust Project, which may involve assessing the security of various components, from the Project in general to specific projects or infrastructure components. This could encompass penetration testing of systems and conducting code reviews for critical components like CI/CD, bors, rustwide, playground, and more.

_The Security Fellow will receive mentorship from Walter Pearce, Security Engineer at the Rust Foundation._

### Crates Fellowship

This role provides the opportunity to develop a comprehensive understanding of crates.io and focus on enhancing its search experience. The Crates Fellow’s objective will be to explore possible, such as incorporating additional metrics for crates and leveraging them to prioritize search results. By working on these enhancements, the Crates Fellow will contribute to optimizing the search functionality on crates.io, thus improving the overall user experience.

_The Crates Fellow will receive mentorship from Tobias Bieniek, Software Engineer at the Rust Foundation._

### Infrastructure Fellowship

The Infrastructure Fellow will be responsible for developing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying infrastructure supporting the Rust language. Specific tasks include updating the infrastructure monitoring setup and optimizing the CI (Continuous Integration) process for rust-lang to enhance its efficiency. By actively working on these aspects, the Infrastructure Fellow will play a vital role in ensuring a robust infrastructure and streamlined development workflow for the Rust language.

_The Infrastructure Fellow will receive mentorship from Jan David Nose, Infrastructure Engineer at the Rust Foundation._

### Compiler Fellowship

The Compiler Fellow will contribute to the Stable MIR project, which aims to provide a stable interface to the Rust compiler, allowing developers to conduct sophisticated analyses without compromising the compiler development speed or raising costs. The Compiler Fellow will have the opportunity to implement this new interface on top of the existing Rust compiler logic, gain expertise in the Rust compiler's mid-level internal representation (MIR) and its utilization, and develop functions that expose a similar structure as MIR, while protecting the internal intricacies of the Rust compiler. Additionally, the person in this role will be responsible for creating comprehensive tests to ensure that these Stable APIs are accurately representing the compiled code.

_The Compiler Fellow will receive mentorship from TBC FIXME_

## General Expectations

RFFs will NOT be required to set and meet specific milestones. They will be asked to prepare a brief update each quarter and have a catch-up call with the Foundation staff. At the end of the fellowship year RFFs will be asked to write a blog post detailing their experiences of the program and reviewing their achievements for publication on the Foundation’s website.

All RFFs will be required to adhere to the [Rust Foundation’s Code of Conduct](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/), which is an extension of the [Rust Project Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct). Failure to adhere to the Code of Conduct may result in the Fellowship being terminated.

## Application Details 

* Applicants will be asked to either select their preferred Mentored Fellowship role (listed above) or describe how they intend to support Rust over the course of the year. Our team will not be looking for a detailed list of activities, but instead for a broad overview of the areas of intended focus. Priority will be given to applicants whose proposed activities align with the priorities of Project Teams and Working Groups.
* Fellowships are open to applications from anyone who will be over the age of 18 at the time of the grant award. Rust Foundation staff, officers, and directors are not eligible to apply for any Rust Foundation grants. 
* Employees of organizations that are Members of the Rust Foundation should contact us at grants@rustfoundation.org prior to completing an application in order for us to assess whether granting a Fellowship might represent a conflict of interest. 
* People who are currently paid to work on the Rust Project full-time will not be eligible for Fellowships, however, we welcome applications from those who are paid to work on Rust part-time.
* We welcome applications from prospective fellows all over the world with different backgrounds. Rust Foundation Fellows do not have to speak English, but they will need to be able to understand enough written English to be able to interact with members of the Project Teams, Rust Project Working Groups, and the Foundation.
* All Fellowship applicants must ensure that they are able to receive financial transfers from the USA. Details can be found [here](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information) of the restrictions to such transactions.
