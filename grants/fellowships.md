<center><h1>Rust Foundation Fellowship Program</h1></center>
<div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
        The Rust Foundation Fellowship program exists to support and acknowledge active members of the Rust programming language community who generously contribute their time and expertise on a voluntary basis. These grants reward individuals who have helped make Rust what it is today and are key to its future success.<br/>
         &nbsp;<br/>
        Rust Foundation Fellows are selected for their Rust experience and potential to enhance the community. Benefits include a monthly stipend during the Fellowship year, funding for career development, and access to mentorship opportunities.<br />
    </div>

<center><h3>Rust Foundation Fellowships will be returning in 2024 for the third year, with a target start date for the new cohort of July 31.</center></h3>
<br>
<div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
        The approach to our Fellowships this year will be similar to the previous years with the following adjustments:<br/>
         &nbsp;<br/>
        1) The monthly stipend will increase from $1,000 to $1,500<br/>
        2) Following grantee feedback, the $2,000 training budget and the $2,000 travel budget will be combined into a single $4,000 allowance<br/> 
        3) Of this combined allowance, up to $1,500 can also be spent on hardware.<br />
    </div>

&nbsp;<br>

<center>The total award for each Fellow will therefore be $22,000 per Fellow for the year. We will make up to 15 Fellowship awards in 2024.</center>

<center><h2>Fellowship Types</h2></center>
<center><p>During the last Fellowship round, we saw in excess of 100 applications. It is likely that the 2024 round would attract even more if the application was unrestricted. To ensure the Fellowships deliver significant positive impacts and applicants do not spend large amounts of time on applications that are likely to be unsuccessful, we have restricted the types of Fellowship in 2024 and applicants must choose from one of these when making their application.</p>
