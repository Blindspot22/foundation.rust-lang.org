<br>The Rust Foundation Fellowship program exists to support and acknowledge active members of the Rust programming language community who generously contribute their time and expertise on a voluntary basis. These grants reward individuals who have helped make Rust what it is today and are key to its future success.</br>
<br>Rust Foundation Fellows are selected for their Rust experience and potential to enhance the community. Benefits include a monthly stipend during the Fellowship year, funding for career development, and access to mentorship opportunities.</br>
