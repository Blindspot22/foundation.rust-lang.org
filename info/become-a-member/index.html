    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>Rust is a large and ambitious project, with over 200 folks in leadership posiitons and even more contributors. Our prices reflect the size of our project and maintainership, and the quality of the experience we provide our teams.</p>
    <p>That being said, we think it is incredibly important for our prices to reflect our deep value in accessibility. Rust is used by companies of all sizes, from all over the world. It is important that Rust Foundation membership be an opportunity for all companies and so we've tried to make our pricing ambitious, but approachable; just like Rust itself.</p>
    <p>If you have questions or feedback about our prices, please don't hesitate to reach out at <a href="mailto:foundation@rust-lang.org">foundation@rust-lang.org</a>.</p>

    <h2>Discounts</h2>
    <p>While the Rust Foundation was founded to help fundraise for the Rust Project, we believe that there are some cases where member companies can provide value above and beyond giving money to the organization. Our discounts are designed to incentivize member companies to spend money in these ways.</p>
    <table id="discounts">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Discount</th>
        </tr>

        <tr id="discount-infra">
            <td>Infrastructure</td><td>15% per 100k USD value</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="discount-commit">
            <td>Commitment</td><td>5% per year >2 years</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Discounts are capped at a maximum of 45% off of membership fees at any tier level. All discounts require approval by Foundation Staff and in the case of Team Members or Infrastructure will be documented in an Exhibit attached to the Membership Agreement.
