    <h1>Become a Member</h1>
    <p>The Rust Foundation is a 501(c)6 non-profit organization incorporated in Delaware, USA. The primary way to participate in this organization is to become a member.</p>
    <div class="cta-box">
        <h3>Too long, don't want to read?</h3>
        <div class="cta-white button"><a href="mailto:membership@rustfoundation.org">Send us an Email</a></div>
    </div>
    <h2>Tiers and Benefits</h2>
    <p>The Rust Foundation currently has 4 tiers of corporate membership: Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Associate.</p>
    <p>We are not yet able to provide memberships for individuals, but this is something that we are looking into for the future.</p>
    <p>A primary benefit of membership is representation on the Board of Directors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Platinum: 1 Board Seat for every Member</li>
        <li>Gold: 1 Board Seat for every 4 Members, Max 2</li>
        <li>Silver: 1 Board Seat for every 10 Members, Max 1</li>
        <li>Associate: No Board Seat</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To learn more about our organization, membership tiers, benefits and more, please check out our <a href="/static/rust-foundation-overview.pdf">Overview Deck</a>.</p>
    <p>If you would like to schedule some time to speak with us about membership, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:membership@rustfoundation.org">membership@rustfoundation.org</a>.</p>
    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>Rust is a large and ambitious project, with over 200 folks in leadership positions and even more contributors. Our prices reflect the size of our project and maintainership, and the quality of the experience we provide our teams.</p>
    <p>That being said, we think it is incredibly important for our prices to reflect our deep value in accessibility. Rust is used by companies of all sizes, from all over the world. It is important that Rust Foundation membership be an opportunity for all companies and so we've tried to make our pricing ambitious, but approachable; just like Rust itself.</p>
    <p>If you have questions or feedback about our prices, please don't hesitate to reach out at <a href="mailto:membership@rustfoundation.org">membership@rustfoundation.org</a>.</p>

    <h2>Discounts</h2>
    <p>While the Rust Foundation was founded to help fundraise for the Rust Project, we believe that there are some cases where member companies can provide value above and beyond giving money to the organization. Our discounts are designed to incentivize member companies to spend money in these ways.</p>
    <table id="discounts">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Discount</th>
        </tr>
        <tr id="discount-team">
            <td>Team Members</td><td>15% per full-time employee</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="discount-infra">
            <td>Infrastructure</td><td>15% per 100k USD value</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="discount-commit">
            <td>Commitment</td><td>5% per year >2 years</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Discounts are capped at a maximum of 45% off of membership fees at any tier level. All discounts require approval by Foundation Staff and in the case of Team Members or Infrastructure will be documented in an Exhibit attached to the Membership Agreement.
