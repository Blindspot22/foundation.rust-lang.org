We launched the Rust Foundation at the beginning of this year with a mission to support the Rust project and maintainers. In our first year, we’ve established a governance structure that works in collaboration with the Rust Project, gained six Platinum Members, added [15 Silver Members](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-11-02-news-fifteenth-silver-member/) and recently funded [24/7 on-call support for the Crates.io service](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/posts/2021-10-18-crates-io-oncall-ferrous-systems/) to support the entire Rust developer community. And we’re just getting started! Our commitment to collaboration and open communication means keeping you connected to our activities and our progress, which is the purpose of our blog as well as the “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) series that we’re announcing today.

You’re invited to join us for the first AMA program, taking place on November 16th at 9am PT/12pm ET. We’re excited about the advancements the Rust Foundation has made, and we know that for the Foundation to achieve its vision, we must connect our projects and initiatives to the needs and interests of the Rust community.

We want your feedback. We want your ideas. We want your questions and concerns. And we’re eager to engage in sustained conversation, which is why we’re setting the AMA town hall series up as a regular occurrence, rather than as a single event. This is a chance for the Rust Foundation board members to speak directly to our community and answer questions in an interactive webinar. The opening session will be led by two Rust Foundation Board members: Mark Rousskov, who serves as Secretary and Project Director, Core and Shane Miller, who serves as Chairwoman and is Member Director, Amazon Web Services. Mark and Shane will share updates on the Foundation’s work to date and take questions directly from the audience.
