  <h1>Introducing Tyler Mandry</h1>
  <h2>by Tyler Mandry, Project Director, Quality</h2>

  <article>
    <p><em>Over the next five weeks, we'll be running a series called &quot;Getting to know the board&quot;, publishing blog posts from each member of the Rust Foundation <a href="/board">Board of Directors</a>, introducing them to the community. You can view the posts in this series <a href="/tags/getting%20to%20know%20the%20board%20series/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello, Rust community! My name is <a href="https://tmandry.gitlab.io/blog/">Tyler Mandry</a>, and I’m excited to serve as<br>
the project director for quality on the board of the Rust Foundation.</p>
<p>My journey with Rust started about five years ago. I was what you might call<br>
a reluctant enthusiast. I love learning new ways of doing things, but I’m<br>
also somewhat skeptical of “new tech hype.” At the time, I worked in<br>
high-performance computing. Eventually I realized a huge portion of our time<br>
was spent chasing down bugs, like segfaults and data races, that were<br>
difficult to reproduce and could never have existed in a language like<br>
Rust.[1]</p>
<p>Feeling the pain on a daily basis that Rust promised to prevent was what<br>
finally got me interested. But what got me hooked – and inspired me to<br>
contribute – was the thoughtfulness and openness of the project itself. The<br>
technical decisions were all made in the open, and it was plain that everyone<br>
cared deeply about making Rust the best it could be. No one knew me in the<br>
Rust community, but I was able to join a working group and contribute changes<br>
right away.</p>
<p>In 2019 I joined Google to work on the Fuchsia operating system, supporting<br>
Rust development, and I began leading the Rust on Fuchsia team in early 2020.<br>
I’ve contributed a number of things in my time here like async/await compiler<br>
optimizations, mentored work like source-based code coverage, and lead the<br>
async foundations working group.</p>
<p>What else should you know about me? Well, when I’m not in front of a computer<br>
I’m often on my bike, most likely listening to a podcast. I just began<br>
learning to play piano – ask me how that’s going in six months.[2]</p>
<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The road ahead <a class="direct-link" href="#the-road-ahead">#</a></h2>
<p>Looking around, it’s becoming clear that Rust will play a big role in<br>
how we write software over the next 5-10 years – or more. Reliability,<br>
efficiency, and productivity is a combination that will be in demand for a<br>
long time to come. I’m extremely excited to see more and more developers<br>
learning Rust every day.</p>
<p>I see the establishment of a Rust foundation as a major step forward in the<br>
maturity of the project, not unlike what releasing Rust 1.0 meant for the<br>
language itself. Starting a foundation makes the project more sustainable<br>
<em>and</em> unlocks a lot of new possibilities. I think the next two years will<br>
involve “unlearning” all the things we thought we couldn’t do, but now can<br>
thanks to dedicated funding.</p>
<p>So, what can the foundation do to improve quality? I have specific ideas, but<br>
I think it’s most important that the project first has an <em>accurate,<br>
comprehensive, detailed, and up-to-date</em> view of how it’s doing. So this year,<br>
I’d like to begin by helping Rust contributors <em>fix blind spots</em> like where<br>
there are gaps in documentation and compiler errors, with the ability to<br>
measure changes over time. Another thing we don’t monitor is how compiled<br>
code actually performs; the compiler team <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/help-needed-corpus-for-measuring-runtime-performance-of-generated-code/6794">has wanted this</a> for a long<br>
time, and the Foundation could help make it happen. Finally, it’d be nice to<br>
have more visibility into changes in dependencies, like LLVM and system<br>
runtime libraries, and how that could affect our pace of development.</p>
<p>This is certainly ambitious, and I don’t expect it all to happen overnight.<br>
But I think the project will benefit greatly from making more informed<br>
decisions, and I hope this will allow Rust to continue the impressive<br>
trajectory it’s had so far.</p>
<p>It’s been a joy to work on Rust, and I get the sense that we’re all just<br>
getting started. I’m looking forward to what the Rust project, including the<br>
foundation, will do in 2021 and beyond. I hope you are too.</p>
<p>[1]: That’s not to say that the language we were using at the time <em>caused</em><br>
the problems, just that it failed to prevent them!<br>
[2]: And in a year, but that seems too distant to motivate me today. This is<br>
the biggest accountability stunt I’ve pulled by far.</p>
